'Not only did these traders lie to their customers, but they created a corrupt culture on＃(the) trading desk by coaching more junior traders to employ the same deceptive and dishonest trading practices we allege in our complaint'. The Securities and Exchange Commission has announced fraud charges against three traders accused of repeatedly lying to customers relying on them for honest and accurate pricing information about residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). The SEC alleges that Ross Shapiro , Michael Gramins , and Tyler Peters defrauded customers to illicitly generate millions of dollars in additional revenue for Nomura Securities International, the New York-based brokerage firm where they worked. They misrepresented the bids and offers being provided to Nomura for RMBS as well as the prices at which Nomura bought and sold RMBS and the spreads the firm earned intermediating RMBS trades. They also trained, coached, and directed junior traders at the firm to engage in the same misconduct. Source: HITC

There has been a resurgence of the caf谷 racer movement over the past few years. It never really went away, but it did seem to go underground for a while. The caf谷 racer movement, which was started in England in the 1950's and has a long history that parallels the birth of the American hot rod movement and the introduction of rock and roll music, is becoming heartthrob of motorcycle enthusiasts! Royal Enfield doing excellent business with their Continental GT and we are witnessing Custom Cafe Racer boom from the bike builders as well! Young Kid Customs from Delhi, built their latest bike, transforming a 1988's Royal Enfield standard 350 into an enchanting Cafe racer! The team shared few words with 350CC.com on the blue Cafe Racer "So this is our third built, a custom caf谷 racer. We tried to keep the design minimal and kept the framework naked as this built is inspired from the old school caf谷 racers that used to roll down the streets of England ..this was our first attempt in this genre of motorcycle.." The design includes a certain classic charm about the way the rider sits on the bike.The dark brown brat styled seat are to aid that majestical blue paint.

Tottenham and Arsenal are gearing up for a battle over teenage wonderkid Breel Embolo, according to Talksport. The 18-year-old, who has impressed for Switzerland since breaking onto the scene, scored 17 goals for Basel last term. He came on as a second half substitute in the loss to England at Wembley last night. Embolo is under contract with Basel until June 2019, but is expected to move on in the coming transfer window with him valued at around 10m. The player has expressed a personal preference to continue his development as Basel, which is thought to be the only reason a move to Wolfsburg failed to materialise before the end of the recent transfer window. Embolo is quoted as saying he did not feel he was ready to move on. But his rapid progress has sparked interest from the north London clubs who are set to make their moves in January for the forward, who has already scored three times in the league this season.

TORONTO - If Toronto s mayor plans to bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, he ll have to quell concerns in his own council about the financial risks involved. The head of the city s budget committee says that now that the excitement over the Pan Am Games has faded, he is feeling more "cautious" about proceeding with a possible Olympic bid. Gary Crawford says too many questions about who would pay for the bid as well as the Olympics remain unanswered, and it s not yet known what impact the Pan Am Games had on the public purse. Cities looking to host the 2024 Games have another two weeks to officially register their interest with the International Olympic Committee, which secures the right to submit a bid. Toronto Mayor John Tory says he s spoken to Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and Prime Minister Stephen Harper about the possibility of a bid, but maintains he wants to carefully weigh the pros and cons before making a decision. A municipal study previously estimated bidding alone would cost between $50 million and $60 million, and hosting the Games would cost between $3.3 billion and $7 billion. The Canadian Olympic Committee, which has been pushing for Toronto to enter the race, says new rules from the IOC would make both bidding and hosting more affordable, but at least one expert says the price will likely be higher than the city previously predicted.

It's time to get "Serious" about not taking everything so seriously. That's the theme of "Serious," the latest offering from E-Reign. E-Reign is a New York-based a hip-hop artist whom critics are hailing as, "A star in the making." The single is an introspective, mid-tempo composition with meaning, message, and mantra. It is also a prime example of what sets E-Reign miles apart from the typical hip-hop artist. Most hip-hop artists compete among each other; however, E-Reign competes against himself. "I'm only as good as my last release," he explains. While "Serious" is a song about not taking everything too seriously, E-Reign is nose-to-the-grindstone about his artistry. He offers, "You always win when you push harder and take on your last best effort." This recipe for success is what has sharpened his artistic skills as he continues to rise to the top of the hip-hop scene in New York City. "Serious" contains E-Reign's typically well-crafted lyrical lines, hooky riffs, and top-notch instrumentation. The real action in this tune is not in "beats-per-minute," but rather "beats-per- mantra. soundcloud.com/ereignindalab www.ereignmusic.com twitter.com/ereignesm instagram.com/futureofnewyork/ www.facebook.com/ereignesm itunes.apple.com/ie/album/serious/id1018938984?i=1018938987
"We need advocacy, not slogans." He said Australia also needs better economic leadership. "It is clear enough that the Government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers. Ultimately, the Prime Minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence that business needs," he said. Mr Turnbull and Julie Bishop met with the Prime Minister and advised that they no longer have confidence in his leadership. Mr Turnbull and Ms Bishop have asked Mr Abbott to hold a ballot for the Liberal leadership. Mr Turnbull has also resigned from Cabinet as Communications Minister. The leadership spill was widely unexpected with MPs from both pro and anti Abbott camps today indicating a spill this week was unlikely. Most were expecting it would happen before the end of the year but not before the weekend's Canning by-election. The move follows months of tensions between Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott. In February Mr Abbott faced a backbench-led spill, however Mr Turnbull did not put his hand up to challenge. It is understood Mr Abbott has indicated he will not stand down from the Prime Ministership without a fight.

New Delhi, Sept. 15 : The government has decided to provide additional 50 days of work to farmers in drought-hit areas under the MGNREGA scheme to provide relief to them in view of deficit monsoon in various parts of the country. The 100 days of work scheme has been provided to rural job card holders under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). The decision was taken after monsoon deficit on Monday reached 16 per cent across the country, which could possibly affect crops and rural income. In a statement, Agriculture Ministry said that the Centre has decided to provide an additional 50 days of unskilled manual work in the current financial year, over and above the 100 days assured to job card holders, in such rural areas where drought or natural calamities has been notified. Rural Development Secretary JK Mohapatra said that a decision in this regard was taken yesterday. He said the drought areas will be notified in consultation with states. Already, Karnataka has declared drought in 27 out of 30 districts, while Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are also likely to declare drought-hit areas in their states. The move will enable states to provide additional wage employment to rural poor in drought affected areas. ANI
12th September 2015, 0 comments A Serbian man convicted over the 2009 murder of a French football supporter in Belgrade was arrested in Greece on Saturday, Greek police said. Dejan Puzigaca was apprehended at Athens international airport as he arrived on Wednesday on a flight from Thailand, a police statement said. The 34-year-old Serbian national, dressed as a monk, showed a fake Slovenian passport. Police sent his fingerprints to Interpol and it was revealed that he was the subject of an international arrest warrant for the murder of 28-year-old Brice Taton, a French national. Puzigaca was sentenced to 32 years in abstentia by a Serbian court over the murder of Taton, who was attacked in a bar by about 30 people in September 2009 ahead of a Europa League football match between Partizan Belgrade and the French side Toulouse. Taton sustained head and chest injuries from the iron bars and baseball bats used by the assailants, and he died 12 days later. Puzigaca and another assailant, Djordje Prelic, were given the stiffest prison sentences as they were believed to have organised the attack. Prelic was arrested in February 2013 in Spain, His initial 35-year sentence was reduced to 15 years after a decision of an appeals court in Belgrade in January 2012. Puzigaca will face the Greek district attorney on Monday. 2015 AFP

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday set September 21 as the date for hearing to resume in actor Salman Khan s appeal against his conviction and sentence for culpable homicide not amounting to murder after his car crashed into a bakery killing one person and injuring four others in September 2002. Justice A R Joshi did not accede to a request from senior counsel Amit Desai who appears for the actor to defer the day-to-day hearing schedule by a couple of days, on the grounds that Khan s trial was to proceed around that time in Jodhpur for the Black Buck case. The judge said one or two days will not make a difference, but added that on that day, depending on the situation a decision could be taken. The counsel who had received a fresh paper-book containing four volumes from the trial court accepted the compilation and the hearing has to now take place on merits of the case. The court would be shut for Ganesh festival on September 17-18. The HC had last earlier asked the sessions court to prepare the paper book keeping the HC manual in mind on relevant documents being included.
ASHBURN, Va. -- Washington Redskins rookie receiver Jamison Crowder will not be suspended over allegations that surfaced in June regarding possible domestic violence, an NFL spokesman confirmed Thursday. In June, photos of a woman with bruises on her arms and a cut lip surfaced on Crowder s Instagram and Twitter accounts, with allegations that they were caused by the Redskins rookie. The comment under the posting read, in part, "Ive had things thrown at me, poured on me, ive been choked, had a concussion... The list goes on." But the NFL s investigation found no basis to support the claims and suspend him, and no police report has ever been filed concerning the alleged incident. At the time, his agent, Tory Dandy, denied that Crowder had hit a woman. Crowder, a fourth-round pick out of Duke, will help the Redskins in the slot and as a returner this season. Crowder has been limited by a hamstring injury and has played in only one preseason game, catching four passes for 41 yards and a touchdown.

On the bright side: the entire Reevesland property is classified as a historic district. But for local residents who fought for the preservation of the farmhouse as county property, the Sept. 19 decision to divide the farmhouse and the surrounding property as two separate parcels was still a loss. While approximately two acres of surrounding land will remain a public park, the farmhouse will be converted into private property with the purchasing condition that the facade be restored and maintained. However, the County Board directed staff to hold off on dividing the property until instructed to do so by the board to preserve the possibility of a private partnership on the property. The decision was opposed by County Board member Walter Tejada, who noted the public backlash against the proposal. "Over 600 people have signed a petition [to preserve Reevesland]," said Tejada, "many of them are from this neighborhood. This is literally right in their backyard." Members of the County Board expressed a measure of Reevesland fatigue. Exasperated, County Board member Libby Garvey asked staff if the issue would be coming before the County Board again, to which staff replied that it would when a potential buyer is found.
NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) - A Nashville woman was arrested on charges that included child endangerment after pills were found in her small child's package of Animal Crackers.

Dear Editor, I have had the pleasure of teaching my granddaughter to drive. During the last two months we have had an education ourselves, that neither of us planned on. We have 'learned' how impatient, rude and downright obnoxious many of you fellow drivers are. I say, many, not all. You tailgate, (the worst one), you swear, throw your hands up, fly by us at an alarming speed, all the while running your mouth and making gestures. You take our place in line at the gas station because we did not move fast enough for you, and then you get out and glare, like we were in the wrong. My granddaughter is shocked and hurt by many of your behaviors on the road. What are YOU teaching her about driving? Maybe you could learn from her. She is cautious, considerate and kind. The next time you come flying up behind someone going slow, remember, it could be your child or grandchild learning to drive. Sincerely, Bonnie Lillie Apalachin, N.Y.
The striker was handed a three-match ban for violent conduct following his clash with Arsenal s Laurent Koscielny on Saturday. Costa had denied an FA charge over the incident, not seen by referee Mike Dean, in which he appeared to raise his hands to Gunners defender Koscielny in the 2-0 win. Earlier on Tuesday Arsenal defender Gabriel won an appeal against his red card for confronting Costa after the initial incident. Chelsea have stated they are "extremely disappointed" and, after Tuesday s 4-1 Capital One Cup win over Walsall, a clearly unhappy Mourinho refused to land himself in trouble. He said: "If I bring examples, if I go deep and if I bring feelings into the discussion a big suspension will be waiting for me and I don t want that. The team doesn t need that, the team lost an important player for three matches and I don t think they need to lose their manager. "Every time you lose a player it s not good for the team. It s easier to accept an injury but this kind of situation goes much more deeper in feelings and the team is hurt. "But now we know something, that retaliation is allowed now. No problem, you can do it." Read the full article on eurosport.co.uk: Jose Mourinho refuses to land himself in hot water over Diego Costa decision View photo .

MELVILLE, N.Y., Sept. 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- In 2008, an HBO drama entitled "In Treatment" debuted and ran through 2010. The program, about a psychologist and his patients, aired five nights a week. It won critical acclaim and numerous honors, including Emmy, Golden Globe and Writers Guild awards. There was clearly an audience for fictitious, meticulously scripted "therapy" sessions. Photo - photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150907/264179 Sponsored by: Today, an innovative nonfiction educational series entitled SESSIONS with DR. MARK LERNER is fostering emotional wellness. This production features a psychologist and his "clients" 〞 people who have walked the journey from victim to survivor and, ultimately, thriver. Instead of scripted sessions portrayed by actors, distinguished "real people" enact a session from years past when they were grappling with a challenging experience. They then elucidate how they learned to harness their painful emotional energy and use it to overcome. Journalistic interviews are highly structured and "cognitive" 〞 thought-based in nature. SESSIONS are prepared yet unscripted, facilitating the expression of authentic thoughts and feelings. Dr. Lerner s "Session Notes," immersed in this production, provide practical strategies and tools that foster emotional wellness.

Bernie Sanders is leading Hillary Clinton by 7 points in New Hampshire, a new poll Tuesday shows. The Vermont independent senator is on top among likely voters -- 43 percent for Sanders to 36 percent for Clinton -- mostly because of his support with unaffiliated voters who are allowed in New Hampshire to take part in the primary of their choice. The race is tighter among registered Democrats. Clinton is leading slightly among registered Democrats with 43 percent of the vote, according to the Monmouth University poll. Sanders has 39 percent of the vote among the group. Sanders receives 49 percent of support among registered independents and new voters compared to Clinton s 26 percent. Joe Biden, who is considering whether to jump in the race, holds 13 percent, with 2 percent supporting Martin O Malley and 1 percent each for Lincoln Chafee, Larry Lessig, and Jim Webb. "In what may surprise some observers, Sanders has an advantage over Clinton among both men (44 percent to 34 percent) and women (42 percent to 38 percent) in the New Hampshire primary," according to a Monmouth statement. "Sanders leads Clinton among voters under 50 years old by 46 percent to 35 percent and voters age 50 to 64 by 44 percent to 34 percent, while Clinton edges Sanders by 42 percent to 35 percent among those age 65 and older." The Monmouth University poll was conducted over the phone from Sep. 10-13, 2015 with 400 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary. This sample has a margin of error of +4.9 percent.
Happy happy eighth anniversary to my beloved 竹, eigenkumquat! I am so blessed to have met you (and in a state that let us get married eight years ago, no less). By now I have no idea what I would do without you, so let's not find out. This year is apparently our pottery anniversary, and though I expected in two years we would get some kind of great traditional present, it turns out ten years is tin. So that is disappointing. But I vote that we keep giving each other tickets to Broadway shows and the like (I can put your card this year in a clay bowl if you like?) and just hang in there until we hit gold. Love you, bean!

NEW YORK -- Yoenis Cespedes has been named the National League Player of the Week for the week of Sept. 7-13. Cespedes batted .345 (10-for-29) with an .897 slugging percentage last week, with four home runs and an MLB-best 12 RBIs, leading the New York Mets to seven consecutive road victories. Since being acquired by the Mets on July 31, in 40 games, Cespedes is batting .308 with 16 home runs and 41 RBIs. "The only guy I can even compare it to closely would be when Barry Bonds would get on a run," Mets manager Terry Collins said of Cespedes recent stretch. "In 1994, Jeff Bagwell did kind of similar stuff. What this guy was doing on the road, every time we needed him to step up, he stepped up."

He continued working his shift, after going home for a dry uniform and a feed of McDonalds.

Posted on September 24, 2015 by Staff report news@wbcowqel.com Two male suspects managed to shake pursuit by Galion police, Crawford County Sheriff's deputies and the Ohio State Highway Patrol late Wednesday evening, but they left the vehicle behind which turned out to be stolen. Galion Police Chief Brian Saterfield said his officers answered a call sometime after 10 p.m. Wednesday about a suspicious vehicle on South Street. When officers responded the vehicle was located but took off. The vehicle was quickly located by the archery range, but the two white males in the vehicle had fled from that scene on foot. Sheriff's deputies and Highway Patrol troopers aided in the search for the two men but they were not located. The vehicle, however, turned out to be stolen from Clinton County in southwest Ohio in what authorities there say was a burglary. Another stolen vehicle was recovered at that scene. Saterfield said later Wednesday night, following the pursuit in Galion, a vehicle was stolen in the Iberia area of Morrow County. Saterfield indicated authorities believe that the suspects they were chasing may also be responsible for taking that vehicle and fleeing. Saterfield said that currently his department is working with Clinton County authorities on the case which remains under investigation. Story 2015 Crawford County Now - Images 2015 Clipart.com

European Union governments agreed on a six-month extension of asset freezes and travel bans on Russians and Ukrainians accused of backing the separatist movement in eastern Ukraine. The curbs on 149 people and 37 organizations were extended until March 15, 2016, the EU said in an e-mailed statement on Monday. The curbs had been set to lapse on Tuesday.

One deceased person was taken off the list. Separate sanctions on trade and investment with Russia run until the end of January.

Pope Francis has been greeted by hundreds of well-wishers in Havana, as he begins a historic visit to Cuba and the United States. The Pontiff s trip comes after he served as a secret mediator between the former Cold War foes - who have now formally restored diplomatic ties after several decades. After greeting him at the airport, President Raul Castro thanked the Pope for his role in the negotiations - but condemned the America s continuing trade embargo against Cuba, and the country s occupation of Guantanamo. In his welcome speech, Pope Francis urged the US and Cuba to persevere with their rapproachment - setting "an example of reconciliation for the entire world". He also applauded the improved co-operation between the Cuban government and the Roman Catholic Church, and expressed hope it will continue. Although many people have turned out to greet Pope Francis as he makes his way to the Papal Ambassador s home, Cuban officials have offered a day s pay to state workers who line the route.

(CNNMoney) - Houston is suing Volkswagen for $100 million claiming its cars that evaded U.S. emission standards "spew dangerous chemicals" in the air surrounding the Texas city. The Harris County attorney filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen Group of America on Wednesday. The city s air quality is below national standards, and the county attorney said the Volkswagen vehicles that skirted emission regulations set back Houston s clean-up efforts. Volkswagen Group is under fire for tampering with some of its diesel models, allowing them to cheat EPA emissions tests. It affects 11 million of the company s vehicles worldwide, and the county says at least 6,000 were sold in Houston. "Harris County has long been plagued with poor air quality due to emissions from various sources, ranging from industrial to vehicular traffic," the county s court filing says. "Volkswagen s deceptive acts have undermined Harris County s efforts to improve air quality, reach attainment status, and protect our citizens." The issue is nitrogen oxide, which turns into a harmful form of ground-level ozone and causes breathing issues. The Volkswagen cars at issue emitted about 40 times the EPA s permissible levels. Houston s air is below national standards and ozone in particular has been an issue for the city, though its problem is not among the most severe in the country. Volkswagen and the EPA declined to comment on the Harris County lawsuit.

The England midfielder flew to New York with club doctor Andy Massey on Monday and will visit orthopaedic specialist Dr James Cozzarelli in New Jersey, where he will undergo treatment on the injury. Henderson has missed Liverpool s last three matches against Arsenal, West Ham and Manchester United, but it is believed surgery to correct the injury is not being considered at this stage. The 25-year-old limped out of Liverpool s 1-0 victory over newly-promoted Bournemouth on 17 August and has not featured since for Brendan Rodgers side. Rodgers had hoped Henderson would return following the international break, but the Liverpool boss could face the prospect of being without him for an extended period. A return date has not be set, though it is hoped Henderson s visit to Cozzarelli will help identify the issue and accelerate his recovery. Liverpool have struggled in the absence of their newly-appointed skipper, picking up just one point from nine and suffering back-to-back defeats to West Ham and Manchester United. (c) Sky News 2

OH DEER ... Deer are natural resource, generating about $450 million a year Published on September 7th, 2015 Rep. Addia Wuchner, R-Burlington, listens to David Flaig of Boone County discuss how the growing deer population in Boone County is having a negative economic impact on his farm during a meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Environment in Frankfort. (LRC Public Information) Originally published on September 5, 2015 : FRANKFORT 〞 Folks, we have lots of deer in Boone County. We are "Numero Uno" in Kentucky for deer population! I get lots of "likes" on pictures I post on Facebook of the white-tail deer and her twin fawns grazing in our front yard. Deer love dining my roses, grape tomatoes and hostas and we all fear running into deer on Pleasant Valley or I-75. After my recent conversation with Bob Flaig, I no longer grumbled about my roses. The Flaig family grow about 800 acres of corn. Conversations with Bob and his son David about the business of agriculture, corn-soybean crop rotation, the science of tassel-silk pollination, the yield per acre and the financial side of farming were very educational. 〞 Addia Wuchner Cincinnati.com Spread the Word
Full coverage: 50th Anniv. of Establishment of Tibet Autonomous Region LHASA, Sept. 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese central authorities sent a congratulation message for the 50th founding anniversary of the Tibet Autonomous Region on Tuesday, stressing the Communist Party of China s (CPC) leadership is the only way for Tibet to realize real autonomy. "Only by sticking to the CPC s leadership and the ethnic autonomy system, can Tibetans be their own masters and enjoy a sustainable economic development and long-term stability," according to the message sent by the CPC Central Committee. Since the establishment of the autonomous region in 1965, Tibet has realized a historical leap forward in its social system. Over the past 50 years, the Party has led the people of the region to make epoch-making achievements, said the message, citing electoral rights, improved living standards and well-protected religion and culture. Tibetan people must adhere to the Party s strategy of governing Tibet, and take national unity, ethnic solidarity as major tasks to ensure national security and Tibet s long-term stability, it read. The People s Liberation Army, People s Armed Police and judicial staff in Tibet must consolidate the unity with the people and make more contributions to Tibet s reform and development, it said.
PRWeb Industrial Magnetics Inc.(IMI) recently introduced their Polymagnet(R) Demo Kit for product designers and engineers. The kit s contents allow users to explore and experiment with the various magnetic functions now made possible with this next-gen magnetic circuitry. Polymagnets are unique in that the surface of the magnet is encoded with a pattern of multiple north and south poles. The polarity pattern can be specifically designed to achieve a desired result or function. These magnetic functions, such as super-strong attachment, shallow field, magnetic spring, magnetic latch, and repelling up close or at a distance, are not possible with conventional magnets, which only possess a singular north & south pole. States Paul Hardy, IMI s Polymagnet product specialist, "Sometimes the best way to really understand the capabilities of new technology is to show people rather than tell them about it. We created the DemoKit so that product designers could hold these in their hands and more easily visualize, brainstorm and test their ideas for Polymagnet applications." The Demo Kit comes in two sizes and contains various Polymagnet samples which showcase these functions. Also included is their new high-res magnetic viewing film for visualizing the magnetic pole patterns in vivid yellow/green color.

Albany, NY -- (SBWIRE) -- 09/29/2015 -- Over the past few decades, a surge in the use of plastics due to increase in consumer demand for safety and convenience in packaged food and beverages has been observed. When it comes to food and beverages packaging, terms such as green , organic , fair trade , and locally sourced have been drawing the attention of consumers in the recent years. With climatic changes taking place, health awareness, and environmental issues are growing. Furthermore, media coverage has made consumers more aware about the factors that are guiding their purchasing decisions, which has been driving the growth in the bioplastics packaging market.
The Cincinnati Zoo's newborn gorilla with its mother Anju. The Cincinnati Zoo's newborn gorilla with its mother Anju. less After celebrating the birth of its 50th gorilla since 1970 last week, the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden has announced plans for a $12 million expansion of its gorilla exhibit. In a video released Tuesday, director Thane Maynard said the new indoor facility would essentially double the size of the current outdoor exhibit. The zoo current enclosure was opened in 1978 and was the first "barless" habitat of its kind in the country, Maynard said. The new indoor exhibit, which will resemble a greenhouse, would allow the gorillas to be seen by the public year-round, provide better tools for the zoo to care for the animals, and offer more ways for the public to learn about gorillas. Maynard said the new facility could be open as soon as the summer of 2017. CINCINNATI.COM It's a girl! Cincinnati Zoo celebrates newborn gorilla

Sep 16, 2015 Ciara, who is enjoying the NYFW, was spotted heading into Barney's for some retail therapy. Even though we are officially still in summer, she already was clad in a pair of over the knee black suede boots. Cool boots, really, but a little too "over" for this time of the year, still. She had tucked a pair of the J Brand Maria High-Rise Super Skinny jeans into her boots, and paired them with a semi-sheer black tank top, a black suede biker leather jacket, and a super cool fringe handbag.

BARCELONA: Atletico Madrid s in-form striker Antoine Griezmann struck twice to earn a comfortable 2-0 derby victory over toothless visitors Getafe that took his side top of La Liga on Tuesday. The France striker, who is developing into a talisman for Atletico, scored at the start of the first half and at the end of the second after a competent display by the hosts. Atletico have 12 points from five games, having only dropped points against Barcelona who have a 100 percent record from four games so far and face Celta Vigo away on Wednesday when Real Madrid, with 10 points from four matches, visit Athletic Bilbao. Atletico controlled the game, having started by pinning Getafe back, but they eased off for long spells against a side incapable of putting them under sustained pressure. Griezmann netted after four minutes with a volley from six metres and wrapped up the win with another close-range finish from a Jackson Martinez pass in the final minute. Valencia's dismal start to the season continued as they lost 1-0 at Espanyol, with Victor Alvarez scoring in the first half. They are eighth with six points after one win and three draws.

Skopje , Sep 8 (EFE).- Juan Mata , the Spanish international from Manchester United , is convinced that after the failure of the transfer of David De Gea to Real Madrid , his return to Manchester on Wednesday will go normally without "any problems". De Gea is expected to return to Man United on Wednesday after the match between Macedonia and Spain in the Euro 2016 qualifiers. "I ve talked with him a lot," Mata said. "There have been hectic and stressful days but he is such a quiet, centered person, nothing changes," he added. Mata is convinced that the level of his fellow Spaniard will be the same because he will not face any problems in returning to United. "David has been the best player in our team for the last two years. His saves have earned us a lot of points. I have no doubt this will be a very good year too," he said.

"For thawri rebels and their backers, the combination of stalled battlefield pro- gress and unsatisfied civil opportunity is dangerous. Success against the regime in the south is a primary part of their local appeal and credibility; if they cannot con- tinue to gain, or enable similar progress in improving quality of life in areas they control, an opening may quickly emerge for a Salafi-jihadi resurgence." Wait: let me guess: those Thawri rebels (by the way, to say Thawri rebels is like saying rebels rebels or tomato tomato) are really moderate and feminist and liberal and secular and even drink whiskey at night?
Karim Benzema struck a double as Real Madrid took advantage of Barcelona's slip at Celta Vigo to move top of La Liga courtesy of a 2-1 success at Athletic Bilbao. The French forward opened the scoring with a predatory finish following Mikel San Jose's woeful back pass and then tapped home his sixth goal in five matches 20 minutes from time after Sabin Merino had levelled with a superb second-half header. Real keeper, Keylor Navas had hoped to break a 40-year-old club record for shut-outs but could do little to keep out the Bilbao forward's header as the hosts dominated the second half after Madrid had wasted a raft of chances in the first period. Cristiano Ronaldo went into the contest aiming to edge closer to Raul's all-time goalscoring record but rarely looked like adding to his own tally on a night when the three points was what mattered most for Benitez and co. The result sees Real move top of La Liga on goal difference from Celta Vigo, with Atletico Madrid and Barcelona one point behind in third and fourth respectively.

There have been a lot of interesting articles on Seeking Alpha over the last 2-3 years making the bull case for ChipMOS (NASDAQ: [[IMOS]]). Some of the more interesting articles include this, this, and this. There are three general ideas I want to talk about that are hinted at but never seem to get fully discussed on this site when it comes to ChipMOS. The first idea is to analyze the incremental gross margin of ChipMOS. The second idea is that ChipMOS has the chance to make an enormous share buyback. The third idea is that ChipMOS is a likely acquisition target. Fixed costs account for a large part of ChipMOS s cost of goods sold. That is the nature of the OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Testing) industry. In Q1 2015, ChipMOS s revenue contribution and utilization by segment was as follows: ChipMOS 1Q15 Revenue By Segment Utilization by Segment Memory/Mixed Signal Testing 23% 68% Memory/Mixed Signal Assembly 31% 64% Display Semiconductor Assembly and Testing 26% 78% Bumping 20% 75% Overall N/A 71% Overall gross margin has been consistently above 20% for the last year. This decent margin was accomplished despite having a significant amount of capacity being underutilized in all four segments of ChipMOS. Because of the high fixed costs (and relatively low variable costs), ChipMOS could cut capital expenditures and still significantly increase its gross profit margin by increasing its utilization rate. Gross profit would move up significantly with better utilization rates. I estimate the incremental

Perriman has been recovering from a knee injury he suffered in late July. Head coach John Harbaugh said Perriman does have a chance to play, but it's not a big chance.

By Michael Shields and Irene Preisinger VIENNA/MUNICH (Reuters) - Austria said on Sunday it planned to end emergency measures that have allowed thousands of refugees stranded in Hungary into Austria and Germany since Saturday and move step by step "towards normality". Austria had suspended its random border checks after photographs of a Syrian toddler lying dead on a Turkish beach showed Europeans the horror faced by those desperate enough to travel illegally into the heart of Europe, which is deeply divided over how to cope. After 71 people suffocated in the back of a truck abandoned on an Austrian highway en route from Hungary, and as thousands headed from Budapest towards Austria on foot, Vienna had agreed with Germany to waive rules requiring refugees to register an asylum claim in the first EU country they reach.

(NBC News) - tonight on NBC. The show ended last season on a dark note for Sophia Bush s character, Detective Erin Lindsay. Lindsay quit the force after giving in to personal demons and hitting rock bottom. It s a turn that Bush loved as an actor. "Oh, absolutely. I love playing her when she s at her worst," she says. "We laugh that the worse off she is, the happier I am at work." Lindsay is still running off the rails in the season opener, but how long that will last remains to be seen.

Reports are out claiming that Paris Saint-Germain pair Edinson Cavani and Adrian Rabiot are still on the radar of Arsenal ahead of what promises to be a frantic transfer deadline day. The Gunners have signed only one player so far this transfer window, goalkeeper Petr Cech, and have always looked likely to dip into the market again. Arsene Wenger is famous for moving late, and could launch a final day pursuit for one of or both of the French club's stars according to the Daily Mail. It has been reported than Wenger is still interested in both, however it would require a sensational offer to prise away Cavani this close to the window closing, especially given the Uruguayan's quality start to the season. A move for defensive midfielder Rabiot looks far more likely to eventuate.

"It sounds like a joke, but unfortunately it isn t," writes Cailey Rizzo. The two main ways selfie-takers were killed this year: falling or getting hit by a train. Among the consequences of the daredevil selfie craze: landmarks and events have started banning selfie sticks or selfies entirely, a park shut down because of people taking selfies with bears , and, as Conde Nast reports, the European Union even proposed making certain types of selfies (those containing a landmark) a crime.

Here is one leukemia patient that is keeping her optimism in shape. [embedded content] Elizabeth Bobbe was shocked to find out that she had cancer after passing out in a parking lot earlier this month. She had been teaching two aerobics classes for her job as a fitness instructor in Winchester, Calif. After being transported to the hospital, Bobbe was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. She has to stay in the hospital while undergoing chemotherapy, but the determined 29-year-old has found creative ways to stay in shape, including challenging the hospital staff to a squat challenge. In the video above, Elizabeth leads the challenge as one doctor and five nurses from the oncology staff at Loma Linda University Medical Center try to keep up. David Bobbe, Elizabeth s dad, says that the fitness instructor s positive attitude has been very inspirational to hospital staff. "Elizabeth has an amazing attitude, I m not exaggerating when I say, she has not ever expressed feeling sorry for herself even once," David said. A GoFundMe page has been set up by Elizabeth s family to help pay for her medical costs while she s receiving treatment. "The doctors, nurses, physical therapist, lab techs, nutritionist and all of her family are blown away by Elizabeth [sic] amazing attitude. She comforts us when we are down," David said.

Rural Funds Group (ASX:RFF) is a real estate property trust which owns a diversified portfolio of high quality Australian agricultural assets that are leased to suitably qualified and experienced agricultural operators (tenants). RFF's property portfolio comprises 27 properties across New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia with a weighted average lease expiry (WALE) of 13 years. The Fund had a total asset value of $241 million as at 30 June 2014. RFF is a rural property owner, not a farmer. It is Australia's only diversified agricultural REIT and one of very few commercial entities actively seeking to provide property leasing solutions to the Australian agricultural sector. The Fund's strategy is to own productive agricultural assets that are leased to experienced counterparts. The leasing arrangement is designed to provide a stable revenue stream to RFF and thus support regular distributions to investors. Capital growth is expected to occur over time as the agricultural property assets increase in value driven by increasing competition for farmland as a result of food security, the growing global population including the emerging Asian middle class. Thus RFF is an avenue for investors to gain exposure to the growing demand for productive, agricultural land whilst receiving quarterly income payments. RFF will pursue the acquisition of additional assets that grow the quantum and diversity of RFF's earnings.

Because most major news outlets are either ignoring this story or at least paying no attention to its obvious racial angles, there's something grimly symbolic in the fact that Flanagan's victims were a reporter and her cameraman. The major media's tendency over the last couple generations has been to sculpt a racial narrative where whites are always to blame and blacks always have an excuse. According to The Script, Dylann Roof is fully responsible for his crimes, whereas in Flanagan's case, society is to blame. Kathy Shaidle s NEW book, Confessions of a Failed Slut , is available HERE .

Created: 09/03/2015 10:21 AM WHEC.com By: WASHINGTON (AP) 〞 Average long-term U.S. mortgage rates rose this week after a sharp drop the previous week, as global markets continued to whipsaw amid economic disruption in China and uncertainty over Federal Reserve interest-rate policy. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac says the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 3.89 percent from 3.84 percent a week earlier. The rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages advanced to 3.09 percent from 3.06 percent. The rates remain well below their levels of a year ago, when the 30-year loan rate was 4.10 percent and the 15-year rate was 3.24 percent. Mortgage rates have been tracking the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, as investors have fled turbulent stock markets in recent weeks for the safety of U.S. government bonds, and then markets have sharply recovered.

NEW YORK, Sept 18 (Reuters) - British rock band The Who on Friday postponed all remaining dates of its 50th anniversary North American tour after lead singer Roger Daltrey was diagnosed with viral meningitis. In a statement on its website, the band, which famously sang "I hope I die before I get old" in its 1965 hit "My Generation," called off some 30 dates between now and December. The Who had last week postponed four dates after Daltrey, 71, fell ill with a mystery virus. "Initially it was hoped that the rest of the tour might proceed, but after extensive tests the seriousness of his condition became apparent when doctors diagnosed Roger as having viral meningitis and prescribed a period of rest," the statement said. Daltrey said doctors told him he will make a complete recovery but that he will "need a considerable time to recover." Several U.S. dates were postponed four months ago because Daltrey had vocal problems. Guitarist Pete Townshend said all shows would be rescheduled for the spring of 2016. Townshend and Daltrey are the sole survivors of the original line-up following the deaths of drummer Keith Moon and bass guitarist John Entwistle. The Who had its first big hit in 1965 with "I Can t Explain." (Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Eric Walsh)

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton opposes a House GOP effort to lift the federal ban on crude oil exports. A campaign spokesman confirmed Wednesday night that the Democratic front-runner does not support the House bill. But the campaign didn't say whether or not she could support the lifting the ban if some type of deal were struck or whether she's opposed to crude oil exports in principle. Clinton's opposition comes the day after the White House said it does not support the House bill, one of a few major proposals moving through Congress to lift the 1970s-era crude oil export ban. The White House said it lets the Commerce Department take the lead on oil exports. Commerce has the power to approve limited crude exports in certain scenarios. The House Energy and Commerce Committee will mark up the chamber's oil export bill on Thursday. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he will bring the legislation to the House floor for a vote within weeks. He pushed back against Obama's opposition on Tuesday, saying he thinks the legislation could win a veto-proof majority in Congress. At a National Journal event on Tuesday, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) wouldn't say whether Clinton would support lifting the export ban as president. Heitkamp, who is pushing the bill in the Senate, said she hopes to reach a compromise on the issue and pass it during Obama's presidency rather than wait until 2017 or later.

The production is directed by Iqbal Khan, who was involved in the 2012 production of Much Ado About Nothing. Share article Next week, the Bridport venue will host two more live screenings. On Thursday, September 17, the Rocky Horror Picture Show will be shown live - before Battle of Britain at 75 will be screening the following evening.

"It's been easy to just blame other people for stuff like that and point the finger, but Black lives should matter to Black lives," Wale says. Wale recently spoke about his views towards the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States.

It said a new version of South Africa s integrated resources plan, which projects its electricity requirements and suggests the energy generation mix needed, will be released in March. "Given that we have a climate change commitment to fulfill, it should not surprise people that the viability of a much larger nuclear contribution in the long term should be tested alongside all other options," Omphi Aphane, deputy director general in the Department of Energy, told the newspaper. Africa s most advanced economy is gripped by an electricity shortage and regular power cuts are hurting economic growth and tarnishing investor confidence. The government aims to procure nuclear reactors to generate 9,600 MW by 2030 but the newspaper said that could be "enhanced further", as the government aims to fulfill its targets to mitigate climate change. Analysts have estimated that the current nuclear building plans could cost as much as $100 billion, making it the country s biggest ever infrastructure project. However, Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson said neither the price nor the contractor had been determined. Opposition parties have expressed concern about the cost and that agreements to build the nuclear plants will be made behind closed doors, without proper public scrutiny. China, France, Russia, the United States and South Korea, as well as Japan and Canada, have all expressed interest in the project and have signed or are close to signing cooperation deals with South Africa on trade and technology exchange. - Reuters

"Investing in the project of reconstruction of Toktogul HPP $450 million, the government expects to increase its capacity by 20 percent," the Vice Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Valery Dil said yesterday at presentation of the project on the second phase of reconstruction of Toktogul HPP.

There is a shortage of generating capacity in the country at the time. Each year, electricity consumption is growing by 10 percent on average. "After the reconstruction, we expect an increase in generating capacity. We need investments in other generating capacities. Financing of the project on the second phase of Toktogul HPP reconstruction by the Asian and Eurasian Development Bank will be some kind of a precedent. We expect that investors will pay attention to other similar projects in our country," Valery Dil concluded.

A change to the most fundamental of things, like the rising and setting of the sun, the love of child and parent, the healthy body falters and fails.

The victim was identified as Md. Shamsur Rahman Shujon 20. Witnesses said 20 construction workers were involved on the third floor in building the bridge between the two buildings belonging to 'Rising Group.' The length of the bridge was about 30 feet.

(Before It s News) davidstockmanscontracorner.com / by Christopher Langner at Bloomberg / September 8, 2015 Investors selling the rupiah on concern Indonesia will suffer a debt crisis risk a self-fulfilling prophesy. The rupiah has slumped to its lowest level since the peak of the Asian financial crisis, when Indonesia was bailed out by the International Monetary Fund. Its nine-week decline is the longest since June 2004. That's unfortunate timing for the nation's government, banks and companies that owe a record $304 billion in foreign debt, almost three times the country's $105.4 billion of international reserves, according to central bank data. Indonesia's currency has plunged 13.3 percent this year, Asia's worst performing after Malaysia, as China's yuan devaluation in August fueled speculation of currency wars in the region. Bonds denominated in the U.S. currency have lost 3.9 percent over the last three months, JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes show, as companies face a vicious cycle of higher debt servicing costs, falling earnings and slumping asset prices. Only Mongolia's debt fared worse in Asia. "The debt servicing costs of these companies will go up and that means impact on leverage and coverage ratios," said Raymond Chia, the head of credit research for Asia ex-Japan at Schroder Investment Management. "The impact could affect a company's reported bottom line as well as dividends, which may cause their stock to drop. That drop could eventually feed through to the bonds given investor sentiment."

The latest news from the crisis of migrants pouring into countries across Europe. All times local (CET): --- 11:50 a.m. British Prime Minister David Cameron says the United Kingdom will accept "thousands more" Syrian refugees to help Europe cope with a massive influx of migrants and refugees. Cameron said Friday his country has already agreed to take around 5,000 Syrians fleeing from their country s war but as the crisis has grown it planned to accept more. He said in a statement during an official visit to Lisbon, Portugal, that his government will announce next week how many more people it will receive and under what terms. He said Britain intends to take Syrians directly from refugee camps in the Middle East, not from places where they have arrived in Europe. He said "Britain will act with our head and our heart" on the issue. He did not take reporters questions.

The Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality (EMM) is ready to help beat the heat with the opening of all new and revamped community pools for the swimming season. In preparation of the splish-splash season, the EMM conducted maintenance and repair work at all its pools during the winter season, while constructing new pools in other areas of the metro. Mr Themba Gadebe, the EMM's spokesperson, said the preparation work also included an advanced training course for lifeguards who will serve as qualified lifesavers, trained by Lifesaving South Africa. "The certification they obtained is valid for a year and must be renewed annually through theoretical and practical examination. In an effort to curb the rising number of drowning cases in community pools and to ensure the residents' safety, the municipality is offering patrons of all ages, from three years old, the Learn-to-Swim programme conducted by qualified swimming instructors," said Mr Gadebe. He said the programme aims to assist a person with no swimming skills, or to even develop intermediate swimmers into advanced swimmers. Ekurhuleni has over 30 community swimming pools, with two lifeguards allocated to each swimming pool who are responsible for all lifesaving duties, facility management, water treatment and testing, asset control, housekeeping and crowd control. The entrance fee to all community pools with a turn-style gate is R5 per person. School children will not be allowed entry to public swimming pools during school hours, unless prior arrangements have been made by their school. This is subject to approval by the EMM Sports and Recreation Department.

Abstract Since the test rig design for chain wear testing generally lacks effective support of theory and software, a new tool was developed based on mathematical methods. The difficulties of design tasks are extracted from the physical system and simplified into a two-dimensional mathematical modeling problem. The nonlinear equations of the model are solved through the application of Newton s method for higher dimension and stratified iterative methods composed of Newton s method, dichotomy and secant method. On the platform of Excel/Visual Basic Application, programs for the iterative algorithms and other supporting functions were written. The calculation results, shown in both values and images, were proved to be identical with actual status of available designs. The application in a new design task proved the CAD-tool to be helpful to design work for chain wear testing.

Speaking at the annual Congressional Black Caucus awards dinner in Washington on Saturday night, President Barack Obama said "we'll do a better job" protecting police officers "if our communities can feel confident that they are being treated fairly." "This is not a new problem. It's just that in recent months, in recent years, suddenly folks have videos and body cameras and social media. And so it's opened our eyes to these incidents. "There is no contradiction between us caring about our law enforcement officers and also making sure that our laws are applied fairly. "Do not make this as an either-or proposition. This is a both-and proposition. "We want to protect our police officers 〞 we'll do a better job doing it if our communities can feel confident that they are being treated fairly. "Hope I'm making that clear. Hope I'm making that clear," President Obama said. The relevant portion of President Obama s remarks begin just after the 54:45 mark:

Mark Cavendish will not race again this year after undergoing an operation on his left shoulder. Cavendish opted to go under the knife after the effects of the crash that ended his involvement in the Aviva Tour of Britain continued to trouble him.

Zamboanga City (CNN Philippines) 〞 The PNP Regional Office 9 (PRO-9) has issued a directive to further tighten security in Zamboanga to prevent the area from being used by Samal kidnappers as an escape route towards Sulu and other areas. PNP Regional Director Miguel Antonio has directed the tightening of checkpoints in case the group will be travelling by land. Antonio has also directed the opening up of communication lines of force multipliers as early warning devices that will assist police in tracking down the group. Zamboanga City Police Office Chief Sr. Supt. Angelito Casimiro said that they have already received a directive from Antonio on what to do in case the kidnappers use Zamboanga City as an escape route but refused to elaborate. Security is being tightened on the coastlines that may serve as possible landing areas as Zamboanga City an be used as a refuelling point by kidnap for ransom groups before proceeding to Sulu.
A new research has found that patients with atrial fibrillation or abnormal heart beats are more prone to stroke risk due to cold weather. Tze-Fan Chao s research states that atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia that increases the risk of ischaemic stroke by four to five times. Chao said that during AF, the electrical activity of the left atrium is disordered that results in stasis of blood in the atrium. The blood pools can result in the formation of blood clots. These clots travel from the heart to the brain causing a stroke. Higher mortality rate of myocardial infarction, stroke and congestive heart failure have been reported in autumn/winter season. A greater plasma fibrinogen level and factor VII clotting activity in the winter has been reported as a possible mechanism. These coagulation factors may lead to a pro-coagulant status in cool climates, which may promote the formation of blood clots within the left atrium and increase the risk of stroke in AF patients. However the risk of ischaemic stroke is higher in AF patients during cool seasons is still not clear. According to a large-scale nationwide AF registry, the risk of ischaemic stroke in AF patients was higher during cool months and seasons. The study is presented at ESC Congress. Source

Head teacher Kelvin Geary confirmed the school is still affected but stressed the number of poorly is pupils is reducing. He said staff are following advice from Public Health England with on-going deep cleaning at the beginning and end of each school day. Supervised hand-washing is also taking place throughout the day.

Flavour of the month TORONTO, August 31, 2015 (LifeSiteNews) 每 A TV ad blitz promoting the Liberal government's controversial sex education agenda has drawn the fire of sex-ed opponents, who say Premier Kathleen Wynne is once again using taxpayer money to push a radical agenda that parents don't want. ... Ontario Ministry of Education spokesman Gary Wheeler had not responded by deadline to LifeSiteNews' question as to how much money the Liberal government is spending on the 30-second television spots, which according to a CTV report, will be released province-wide today "to coincide with the start of the school year." The TV ad's vignettes include a boy looking at a wedding cake topped with a statuette of a homosexual couple, a teenage girl who appears about to take a semi-nude selfie, and a boy being cyber-bullied 每 all situations teens find confusing, the CTV report notes. The Liberals have already poured $1.8 million into a summer radio ad campaign promoting the sex-ed curriculum, which critics also denounced as "whitewashing" a sex-ed agenda that has been increasingly opposed by parents, and which American psychiatrist Miriam Grossman says is not based on science but fueled by ideology. Wynne and Minister of Education Liz Sandals "are wasting our hard-earned money on the promotion of wrong things," says Khalid Mahmood, president of Thorncliffe Parents Association (TPA), which is based in Wynne's Don Valley West riding.

10:59 a.m. CDT SIMI VALLEY, CA (WTAQ) - Governor Scott Walker says he s frustrated with the lack of air time he received in Wednesay night s GOP presidential debate. An analysis shows that Walker spoke for 8:30 of the 3-hour forum, while Republican frontrunner Donald Trump spoke twice as long. Walker was only asked 3 questions by the moderator, CNN s Jake Tapper. But the governor and his aides say Walker tried making the most of them -- including a challenge to Trump in which Walker questioned his fiscal record as a real estate magnate. Walker also had words for Tapper, when the moderator said he was ducking a question about the minimum wage. The governor was looking for a solid performance, after his poll numbers dropped following the first GOP debate a few weeks ago. 11 of the 16 GOP White House hopefuls took part in the CNN forum.

JONESBORO, AR (KAIT) - Employers gathered at the St. Bernards Auditorium Wednesday to get advice on how to deal with violence in the workplace. A lunch and learn was hosted on the topic. Kathleen McComber is a faculty member at UAMS in the College of Public Health and Webster University. She talked to employers about warning signs and how to prepare themselves and their employees. "Developing a program and policy within your organization and just understanding things proactively to hopefully prevent such a horrible incident or be prepared should it happen in the workplace," McComber said. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, workplace violence incidents have increased by 41% over the past year. The CEO of St. Bernards Healthcare Associated Regional Providers Beverly Nix said she approached Chris Barber of St. Bernards with the idea because she wanted to share this information with community employers. "I think the thing she said that got my attention the most was that there are red flags and that you watch for attitudes," Nix said. "You watch for behaviors that can kind of alert you to the need to watch this person a little more." Around 150 people attended Wednesday s event. Copyright 2015 KAIT. All rights reserved.

If the report on Bloomberg is true, then yes. Bloomberg reports that people familiar wiht the matter said that the FTC and the Justice Department work on an investigation. The FTC has met with technology companies who accuse Google to give priority to its own services on the Android platform. The investigation is still in its early stages and can fizzle into nothing. Google is offering its services on Android. Most of these services are free. A technology company offering a competing service to a Google service has a hard time to make a business. To make an antitrust case out of this situation will be difficult. So what has Google done wrong with Android? It is not clear yet what exactly the FTC tries to find with this investigation. Google faces scrutiny from several fronts. The European Union is also investigating Android, after Microsoft, Expedia and Nokia have complaint. The EU is also gunning for Google over its search engine.
By ANI | ANI 每 New Delhi, Sept.24 (ANI): Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Somnath Bharti, who is involved in a domestic violence case, has moved the Supreme Court seeking protection from the arrest after the Delhi High Court had rejected his anticipatory bail plea. According to reports, Bharti has sought a direction that the Delhi Police be restrained from arresting him till his petition challenging the High Court order is decided. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier said that the former law minister Bharti, who has been booked in a domestic violence case, is becoming an embarrassment for AAP and his family, and therefore, should surrender. "Somnath shud surrender.Why is he running away?Why is he so scared of gng to jail?," the Delhi Chief Minister tweeted. "Now he (Somnath Bharti) is becoming embarrassment for party n his family. He should cooperate with police (sic)," he added. The High Court had, on Tuesday, dismissed his anticipatory bail plea saying that the allegations against him were backed by documentary proof. The AAP MLA is facing a non-bailable warrant against him in a domestic violence and attempt to murder case filed by his wife, Lipika Mitra. (ANI)

I'm stranded on an island, and everywhere I look, I see its creator〞a 43-year-old man named Jonathan Blow. To clarify, he's not hanging around this island, and there s no Jimmy Buffett-like resort plastered with his branding. Also, this place is a virtual island, which I'm walking through by way of a gamepad hooked up to a PC. It makes up the entirety of a video game called The Witness . In some ways, I see Blow damn-near literally. This sunny, tree-filled place has been populated with sculptures. They're largely vague and unexplained, with no plaques or tour guides to clarify their purpose. Abstract as they are, they look pained and personal〞and at least one of them looks like Blow himself.

DANNY WELBECK has undergone knee surgery after failing to recover from an injury sustained last season. The attacker sustained a cartilage injury at the end of April last term and has been out of the squad ever since due to rehabilitation. However, Arsenal have confirmed his progress has stalled and the damage caused will have to be rectified with an operation - keeping him sidelined for months . And official club statement reads: "Danny Welbeck has undergone surgery on his left knee after being unable to sufficiently step up his rehabilitation work. "The striker has been working throughout the summer to recover from the injury sustained at the end of April. "It had been hoped he would avoid surgery but after increasing his training workload, the injury to his cartilage did not respond as well as hoped and the decision was taken last week for him to undergo surgery by a leading specialist in the field. "Danny is now expected to be out for a period of months and everyone at Arsenal wishes him well. Arsene Wenger had thought to be concerned over Welbeck s fitness ahead of the new season , hence reports suggesting he was in the market for a new striker, but the Frenchman failed to to bring anyone in on deadline day, despite links with Karim Benzema and Edinson Cavani. Welbeck scored eight goals in 34 games in his first season at the Emirates after signing from Manchester United for 16million.
By The Canadian Press LANGLEY, B.C. - Mounties say officers seized a stolen handgun, other weapons, cash and drugs after a complaint about public pot smokers in Langley, B.C. RCMP say they ll be recommending charges against the males aged 17, 20 and 23, who are all from neighbouring Surrey.

Shares in Volkswagen, which plunged early in the week before stabilizing, were up 1.5 percent as its board meets to find a new CEO and discuss the scandal.
D谷tails samedi 26 septembre 2015 10:17 Source : AllAfrica editorial FEDERAL Government s plan to introduce a school feeding programme for primary school pupils in the country is a demonstration of its commitment to tackling the rot in Nigeria s education system from the root. The idea is laudable and should be supported by all who crave a great future for the country. That abject poverty is wreaking havoc in most families is no longer in doubt and families in this predicament, who can hardly afford one meal a day, find it extremely difficult to send their kids to school.

There are as many as 30 million small businesses in the U.S., and all of them 〞 even the profitable ones 〞 run the risk of cash flow problems. If not properly managed, negative cash flow can lead companies straight to bankruptcy. So, if your company is generating a profit, do you still risk having inadequate cash flow? Yes, you do. When you incur obligations for future payments, you run the risk of being short of cash if you aren't correctly managing the timing of incoming funds. Future＃
Dubai's largest online classifieds website, dubizzle, has invested $1 million and helped the launch of a new mobile only fashion marketplace, called Shedd. The application was created by two former dubizzle employees. The Shedd is the first of its kind application in the UAE that provides a platform for selling good second hand fashion items as well as new products from small businesses and independent designers. It allows the users to post items for sale quickly and with ease for free. Buyers can filter items, chat with other users and are able to like and comment on different items as well. It offers a similar experience like Instagram, but users can make purchases along with it. The application is also integrated with PayPal. Shedd offers customer protection with full reimbursement and postage if the purchased item doesn't arrive or if it is faulty. Shedd also allows face to face trade, in case the customer does not want to make an online purchase. The application was developed by Tariq Zabian and Alex Hutley, previous GM Emerging Markets and Marketing Director respectively. They mentioned that they were inspired by the growing fashion industry in the UAE and the many new local and international brands in the region. Dubizzle GM Barry Judge claims that Shedd will completely transform how consumers buy and sell fashion goods, similar to how dubizzle changed the purchase and sale of second hand goods. This could be the start of a new trend in the Middle Eastern market, what do you think? The post appeared first on www.tbreak.com .
I went out for a walk today at lunch, partially to do something as I have very little work to do, and the other part just to get away from entitled coworkers surly attitude. I so wish we had cubicles or walls. The air was fine on the walk out...I walk 1.5 miles to the L st Bath house and then 1. miles back. A wall of humidity hit on the way back. Oi. I make it a habit to look at all the milkweed I pass and today was the first day that I have seen a Monarch Caterpillar. In the last 8 years this is only the second time I have seen one. It is funny, or silly, or dumb, but for a few minutes I was able to forget about all the crap going on. I wish I had my camera, or even my iPad to take a pick. Oh well, live for the minute. I hope it is still there tomorrow. (not sure how quickly it will eat that particular stem of milkweed. I have never seen a crysalis before.

Living through 22 Prime Ministers and four monarchs, an Enfield woman has brought up her century. Annie Costar, of Albany Park care home, celebrated her 100th birthday with friends and family as she received her telegram from the Queen. With six great grandchildren, four grandchildren and two children, it was a tight squeeze at the care home as a large birthday cake was presented to Mrs Costar. Originally from Chingford, three of Ms Costar's brothers and her husband fought in the war. "Her husband was in the Navy and their uniform trousers had very wide legs and because Annie was so small she was able to make herself a skirt and jacket out of his trousers." Said her daughter, Rita. Mrs Costar was left scarred by horror films when she saw King Kong in 1933 in black and white. Share article Watching with her cousin, the 100-year-old screamed through most of the film. The eldest of nine children, Mrs Costar came to the care home in September 2
The Libertarian Party added a new page to its website under the tab "Elections." The page, entitled " 2016 Presidential Candidates ," provides the Libertarian Party's criteria for recognizing presidential candidates and lists five candidates who meet that criteria. The Libertarian Party recognizes 2016 Presidential candidates who have campaign websites, are dues-paying members of the LP, have met all U.S. Constitutional requirements to serve in office as president, and are not running for the nomination of any other political party. They have filed with the FEC, with the exception of Darryl Perry, who has chosen not to file as a protest against the FEC, claiming it lacks constitutional authority.
SYDNEY--The number of Australian home-building permits rose by 4.2% in July from June, boosted by the country s record-low interest rates. In a positive sign for the construction industry, approvals to build or renovate houses and apartments also rose by 13.4% from a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. Housing is one of the few areas of strength in the economy as a long resources boom cools. The central bank has cut interest rates to a record low in a bid to spur activity in areas such as retail and housing construction that have led previous expansions. At the same time, policy makers are worried about the housing sector overheating, leading to risky investment that could derail a fragile economic recovery. Permits to build houses fell by 3.0% from a month earlier, while approvals for apartments and other dwellings rose by 6.1%. Write to Vera Sprothen at vera.sprothen@wsj.com
MUMBAI, Sep 2 (Agencies): The Mumbai police registered a fresh FIR against self-styled godwoman Radhe Maa and more than a dozen of her family members as well as associates, based on a complaint filed by TV actress Dolly Bindra, a senior police official said here today.

 To be honest wouldn t call this a terrific drama nor a must watch series but do admit I really have been enjoying this drama quite a bit. There were a few slower episodes in the middle but it s picked right back up and going to miss watching this every week once it ends. Wonder if there s any plans for another Nogi drama, may depend on what the ratings for this show are but seeing how it airs after midnight on a Friday the ratings won t be too high. If it s around 3% that s a fair number which is what it was averaging after the first few episodes, haven t seen any recent numbers for the show though. Will be hopefully at this same time next week to look at the 11th episode, if it is a two-parter will only have a real mini recap to let you know what my plans will be.

Hungary s prime minister has said member states are forced to protect themselves from the "brutal threat" of mass migration until Europe organises a united response to the refugee crisis. Prime Minister Viktor Orban s government has built a fence to keep out refugees on the Serbian border and is rapidly constructing a similar 3.5-metre-high steel fence on the Croatian border. Foreign ministers from four eastern European nations are meeting for talks on the migrants crisis, ahead of an EU meeting of interior ministers tomorrow. Croatia has confirmed it will demand Greece stop moving refugees from the Middle East on to the rest of Europe at the EU meeting.
Fighting global warming: the Chevy Volt The Chevrolet Volt, a concept car that the Obama administration forced into production a few years ago, has been a big flop. Only eight thousand have been sold so far this year--despite a $7,500 federal tax credit available to people who purchase the plug-in hybrid. Sales are way down from last year. Still, as they say in the automobile business, "there is an ass for every seat." Just make sure your posterior is on the on the west coast or the northeast because you won t be able to buy a 2016 Volt anywhere else. The Volt is manufactured in Michigan--where you won t see it inside any showroom unless it s a leftover 15 model. General Motors says the 16 will be a short model year for the Volt and the 2017 edition will be available nationwide.
 cases , Dengue , fever , southern , Taiwan News Online , total Taipei, Sep 27 (IANS) The number of dengue fever cases in Taiwan has increased to 17,112, with 98.39 percent occurring in Tainan and Kaohsiung cities, the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) said on Sunday. As of Saturday, 14,811 cases had been reported in Tainan, accounting for 86.55 percent of the total, an increase of 366 cases from the previous day, Taiwan News Online reported. Kaohsiung has had 2,025 cases, or 11.83 percent of the total, the CDC said. Forty-two people have died of the disease since the outbreak in May, with the cause of death in an additional 42 cases as yet undetermined. The disparity in the occurrence of cases is being attributed to different species of mosquitoes in southern and northern Taiwan. In addition, the medical profession and members of the public are familiar with dengue fever symptoms which means a full blown national outbreak is unlikely, CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang said. The spike in dengue fever cases is unlikely to ease until January, by which time the total number of cases could reach 30,000-37,000, Chuang added.

SYRACUSE, NY -- The owner of the Creole Soul cafe downtown said the electricity and gas were off at his newly remodeled home early Wednesday morning when, as sheets of rain fell outside, the home caught aflame. The blaze injured a firefighter, who has since been treated and released from the hospital, and devastated the house, said owner Darren Chavis in an interview at his cafe Wednesday. He and his family had been renovating the home for four to five months and were planning to move in this week, he said. "I just don t believe this happened," he said. Creole Soul Cafe, 128 E. Jefferson St., in Syracuse. Don Cazentre He s especially concerned because gas and electricity were not on at the house, so he has no idea how the home could have ignited. The home is on the 300 block of Bruce Street. Firefighters arrived at the home after getting a 911 call from a neighbor at 12:37 a.m., and an investigator said the fire started on the first floor and rose to the attic. Chavis arrived soon after firefighters extinguished the blaze and was "dumbfounded" at what he saw. The injured firefighter suffered second-degree burns to his lower left leg, said investigator Allen Williams.

Bronte Campbell has ended another of her big sister s streaks, sharing the 2015 Australian Swimmer of the Year award with Emily Seebohm. Bronte Campbell has ended another of her big sister s streaks, sharing the 2015 Australian Swimmer of the Year award with Emily Seebohm. The elder Campbell, Cate, has won the award the past two years but Bronte was rewarded for a breakthrough year, which included snapping Cate s unbeaten run in the 100m freestyle that stretched back to 2012. The younger Campbell was recognised after becoming the first Australian to win the 50/100m freestyle double at the recent world swimming championships in Kazan, with Cate claiming bronze in both. Bronte s win does mean another slice of history for the sisters, who are the first siblings to have won the award, and sets up an intriguing run in to the 2016 Rio Olympics. The success of Australia s swimmers in Kazan proved too hard to split as Campbell shared the honours with backstroker Seebohm, who broke her individual gold medal duck at the championships. Seebohm came home with golds in the 100 and 200m backstroke, while the pair teamed up with Cate and Emma McKeon to win a third gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay. The 23-year-old put her Olympic rivals on notice with her win over the USA s reigning champion Missy Franklin in the 200m backstroke. It is the first time the award has been shared since 2003, when swimming legends Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett split the honours, at the peak of their powers. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
Updated: 4:01 pm, Sep 19, 2015 ANTIQUES experts will be giving free advice at Webbs Garden Centre in Wychbold on Tuesday (September 22). The Midlands based firm, Fellows, are specialists for valuations and antiques, jewellery and watches. People who have wondered if their antique at home is worth something can now find out. There will be four specialists on the day to help, each with their own expertise. Mark Huddleston, antique and fine art specialist, said: "Enjoy being able to share our knowledge on the heritage of a piece." The most peculiar item Fellows has been valued is a tin of dehydrated onions that was taken by the Scott's Antarctic expedition to the South Pole which they didn't open. The garden centre's chairman, Ed Webb said he was delighted Webbs was hosting the event.

Homs (Agenzia Fides) - Father Jacques Murad and about 270 Christians and Muslims taken hostage by jihadi militias during their offensive in southeast of Homs are alive, and their condition is currently considered quite "stable and secure". Some heads of local ecclesial communities are carrying out negotiations through mediators to obtain their release as soon as possible. This is the only certain information provided to Agenzia Fides by local sources regarding the fate of the Syrian priest who belongs to the monastic community of Deir Mar Musa - kidnapped on May 21 by a group of kidnappers while he was in the monastery of Mar Elian - and other Christians and Muslims captured by jihadists in August. The sources contacted by Fides confirm that all the hostages are still in Quaryatayn, and specify that the news on the story of father Murad broadcast in recent days by Lebanese television network Nursat TV did not include any statement regarding the religious person kidnapped, but only reassuring considerations about his fate, expressed by another priest.

By | New Straits Times 每 KUALA LUMPUR: The High Court set Oct 1 to deliver its verdict on firearm-and-bullets possession appeal by a cabbie linked to the murder of banker Hussain Ahmad Najadi. Judge Kamardin Hashim set the date today after hearing submissions in the appeal by taxi driver Chew Siang Chee against his 14-year jail sentence and six rotan strokes for possession of a pistol and four live bullets. Previously on Sept 4 last year, High Court judge Datuk Mohd Azman Husin had dismissed 46-year-old Chew s appeal against the Sessions Court conviction and jail sentence handed down on Feb 17 the same year. However on Aug 19(this year), the Court of Appeal ordered Chew s appeal be reheard before a different High Court judge on the grounds that Azman may have lacked objectivity when dismissing the bid to set aside the conviction. Azman had heard the murder case against a car repossessor alleged to have gunned down 75-year-old Hussain at the Kuan Yin parking lot at Lorong Ceylon Dang Wangi, between 1.30pm and 2pm on July 29, 2013. During the murder trial, Chew had testified that he ferried murder accused Koong Swee Kwan, 46, to the scene of the crime. The Sessions Court had found Chew guilty of possessing a 9mm Walther PPK/S with 9mm bullet magazine and four live 9mm bullets, at B-15-2, Desa Cindaimas Condominium, Jalan Sekutu, off Jalan Kuchai Lama, Brickfields, at 5.45pm on Aug, 2013. Counsel Hisyam Teh Poh Teik acted for appellant Chew while deputy public prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin appeared for the public prosecutor, who is the respondent in the appeal.

Lake County Sheriff s Office detective Christopher Covelli says evidence technicians returning to the scene of Tuesday s shooting in the village of Fox Lake made the discovery Friday afternoon.

Unexpected Playmate: Fox Wants Dog To Come And Play With Her Kirby the dog has an unexpected playmate when a fox living in the neighborhood comes by for a visit. Kirby s guardians suspect the fox might think Kirby s a fox as he kind of looks like one. "This fox lives near our house and has interacted with our dog quite a bit, but this was definitely the craziest encounter we have seen between them. We now regularly hear that crazy bird-like scream the fox makes＃" Ki Steiner says. Fox is a common visitor to gardens and farmland, and can be found in almost every habitat. It is a highly adaptable species, scavenging on whatever food is available, and even venturing into towns and cities for scraps. Most fox vocalizations are quiet and used for communication between individuals in close proximity. The most unusual is called "gekkering;" it s a guttural chattering with occasional yelps and howls, like an ack-ack-ack-ackawoooo-ack-ack-ack. Gekkering is heard amongst adults in close encounters and also amongst young kits playing (or play-fighting). VIDEO dog, fox ↘ Newer Post Older Post ↙ Home

HAUSER, Ore. -- A Monmouth man was air lifted via basket to Bay Area Hospital after sustaining injuries Sunday in an ATV accident on the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area neal Beal Lake in Hauser. 23-year-old Benjamin Morehouse got separated from his group and flipped a Class I ATV (quad) over backwards while trying to climb a hill, according to the report. Officials say he sustained a debilitating hip injury while being pinned under the ATV.

After they were unsuccessful in trying to extricate Morehouse, they called 911. Medical crews on scene determined Morehouse needed to be air lifted via helicopter from the location. The sheriff's office coordinated with the USCG Air Station, North Bend, and was lifted via basket and transported to Bay Area Hospital. No additional information about the extent his injuries has been released. Coos County Sheriff's Office, Hauser Fire & Rescue, Bay Cities Ambulance, Oregon Dunes Patrol and the United States Coast Guard all responded to the crash.
Tickets for England s pivotal Rugby World Cup match against Australia on Saturday are fetching a record 4,000 apiece on the re-sale market. The price is a record for seats at any match other than a final, not just in rugby union but across all sports, says re-sale platform Viagogo, where the tickets were sold. England almost certainly have to beat the Wallabies in the Pool A showdown at Twickenham to avoid becoming the first hosts of the tournament to be eliminated at the group stage. Rugby fans are so desperate to see it that the re-sale price for the must-win fixture is curently higher than for seats at the competition s final. The 4,000 price tag also beats the previous record for a non-final sporting event re-sold on the same platform: tickets for Andy Murray s 2013 Wimbledon semi-final, which fetched 2,800 each. "This is the highest price ever paid for any non-final sports event, even outstripping prices for the final, suggesting fans are desperate to see what could be the greatest rugby game in recent history," said a Viagogo spokesperson.

Could Cancer decoy attract and capture malignant cells? 2015 Study abstract Breast cancer is a leading cause of death for women, with mortality resulting from metastasis. Metastases are often detected once tumour cells affect the function of solid organs, with a high disease burden limiting effective treatment. Here we report a method for the early detection of metastasis using an implanted scaffold to recruit and capture metastatic cells in vivo, which achieves high cell densities and reduces the tumour burden within solid organs 10-fold. Recruitment is associated with infiltration of immune cells, which include Gr1hiCD11b+ cells. We identify metastatic cells in the scaffold through a label-free detection system using inverse spectroscopic optical coherence tomography, which identifies changes to nanoscale tissue architecture associated with the presence of tumour cells. For patients at risk of recurrence, scaffold implantation following completion of primary therapy has the potential to identify metastatic disease at the earliest stage, enabling initiation of therapy while the disease burden is low.

A health centre has been rated "inadequate" after poor staff training, recruitment and leadership were found to put patients at risk of harm. The Care and Quality Commission (CQC) placed Hadley Health Centre in Telford into special measures. It was given the rating in three of five assessment areas following an inspection on 10 July. The health centre, which serves about 3,500 people, has yet to respond to the report. The CQC inspectors found "staff said they did not have job descriptions" and that not all staff "could recall" when they last had training. For example, some staff had not received chaperone training and its policy was last updated in 2004. The CQC said "one staff member said that the culture at the practice did not lend itself to open reporting of concerns". However, the inspectors found that patients were positive about staff and said they were treated with compassion and dignity. Hadley Health Centre will be inspected again in six months.

The Dutch club are returning to the group phase of the competition for the first time in seven years. "We have respect for each opponent but we are not scared," Cocu told reporters on Monday. "Manchester are an absolutely top team but that doesn't mean we don't have a chance. "We ll have to reach above our potential, that's the way you get big results. If you don't do it then it becomes a lot harder, details are very important against these sort of teams." PSV are without Dutch international full back Jetro Willems due to a long-term injury. Striker Adam Maher was back in training on Monday after missing the 6-0 victory over SC Cambuur at the weekend but he is deemed to be short of match fitness.

"We are going to give everything we can. We have to ensure we leave the field at the end of the match with the feeling that we did everything we possibly could." PSV will be featuring in the group phase for a Dutch record 14th time. Back in 2008 they finished last in their section behind Liverpool, Atletico Madrid and Olympique de Marseille.

While transforming your kitchen you will need an ideal space and option where you can save some cost. Kitchen installation can be a costly option but your entire budget will depend on the amount of space available. If these things are not done by a professional it might lead to a massive disaster. Here are some of the reasons why you need a professional to do your job.

Malaysia has the highest rate of obesity among Asian countries, with 49 percent of women and 44 percent of men bound to be obese. We also have the highest number of diabetes among ASEAN countries, with one in five adults above the age of 30, or about 3.6 million Malaysian afflicted by this disease. According to the Health Ministry, diabetes cases have more than doubled in Malaysia over the last four years. The Health Ministry also cautions that the increase in the number of diabetic patients correlates with the increase in the number of obese people. Overweight people are ten times as likely to develop type-2 adult-onset diabetes. Bariatric surgeon Dr. KC Cha joins consultant urologist Dr. George Lee to discuss a new study which suggests that weight loss surgery can cure half of patients with type-2 diabetes for at least five years.

World Bulletin / News Desk Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) co-Chairman Selahattin Demirtas said Sunday that the solution to the current conflict in Turkey s southeastern regions was negotiation and that his party neither approved nor accepted conflict. The Kurdish conflict was reignited following the July 20 suicide bombing in Suruc, which was blamed on Daesh. The renewed violence ended the "solution process" negotiations officially initiated in early 2013, aimed at ending the 30-year conflict between the PKK and the Turkish state. "If we had believed that there was nothing to do, we would not be in the parliament," Demirtas told reporters during his visit to the southeastern province of Diyarbakir. HDP passed the 10 percent threshold with 13.12 percent votes to take 80 seats last June -- marking the first time it entered the parliament as a party. But it will have to repeat the feat as Turkey is headed to snap elections on Nov. 1 as parties in Paliament proved unable to agree on terms to form a coalition government. Demirtas said that a break was needed to the rivalry opposing political parties: "Let s seriously discuss coming to the table for peace. This is our call."

'In a continuing cover-up by Child Protective Services ("CPS') in Texas, Judge Keith Dean this week ordered the removal of a YouTube video produced by a 13-year-old boy that exposes the sexual and physical abuse that he and his brother endured while in CPS foster care. The video also reveals the 377-day nightmare suffered by him and his six siblings after they were ripped from their loving family and placed in four different foster care facilities out of county. The mother told Breitbart Texas "they are trying to rake this abuse under the rug." Breitbart Texas has procured the YouTube video from a source outside the family.' Source
Wayne Rooney has overtaken Sir Bobby Charlton as England s record scorer after netting his 50th goal in Tuesday night s Euro 2016 qualifier with Switzerland at Wembley. Rooney equalled Charlton s record, which has stood for 45 years, with a penalty in last Saturday s 6-0 win at San Marino in Group E before he was substituted. His withdrawal gave him the opportunity to notch his half century at Wembley, and he duly obliged six minutes from time. Again it was from the penalty spot as England were awarded a spot-kick when Raheem Sterling was felled by Stephan Lichtsteiner. Referee Gianluca Rocchi had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and immediately home supporters chanted "Rooney, Rooney". Share article He did not disappoint his expectant public, firing into the top corner. The Manchester United striker punched the air with both hands before celebrating with his team-mates.

A boy died yesterday after he plunged from the roof of a four-story building, Jersey City officials confirmed. The identity of the boy, who authorities say was 13 years old, is not being released at this time, Jersey City spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill said. The boy had just started his freshman year at Dickinson High School last week, schools officials said. He graduated from Middle School 7 in June. Police investigating the boy s death do not suspect foul play at this time, Morrill said. Police responded to the corner of Baldwin and Hopkins avenues at 7:50 yesterday morning after the boy had plunged four stories. The boy was rushed to Jersey City Medical Center-Barnabas Health, where he was pronounced dead, Morrill said. A family member declined to comment yesterday afternoon, but neighbors and friends say the boy s death is the second suicide in the family in two years. The boy s father killed himself in India two years ago, they said. "Everybody s puzzled" why the boy decided now to take his life, said Bharat Patel, 60, a family friend. A woman who lives across the street from the boy s Hopkins Avenue home said she saw the incident s aftermath. "So sad. I came out, and everyone was crying," said the woman, who asked not to be identified. Jersey City schools spokeswoman Maryann Dickar said grief counselors were dispatched to School 7 and Dickinson High yesterday "to provide additional support." Journal staff writer Terrence McDonald contributed to this report.

Hi Folks, Fly fished for smallmouth with clients yesterday afternoon out of my motorboat. Beautiful afternoon with air temperatures around 70 degrees. The surface temperature was 68 degrees. The foliage is beginning to change and looked pretty nice on the water yesterday. When we began the day the lake was flat, by the end of day we had rain showers move in and wind pick up from the south. We fished the surface the entire afternoon with lots of action. We had well over 20 smallmouth come to the fly. However, most of the fish were not large adult bass but the young guys. Pretty fun watching the fish rise in the clear water to eat the fly. The pattern of the afternoon was setting the boat up in deep water 20 to 30 and casting at sharp drop offs from the shoreline where there was downed wood. Shade line was another key component. The fly of the day was a 8 chartreuse foam crease fly. The long profile of the fly made a difference in drawing interested as we never had one fish rise to a traditional popper. Well, finally some much needed rain. Looks like rain all day, perfect! Remember to clean your gear and keep the non-native species at home. Have Fun, Willy

As I ve written in a previous blog entry, we had a really nice time and a fun-filled day with the kids over the weekend. I shot quite a few photos and even captured some video of our day. We started at Shelburne Farms ... then went out to lunch at The Olive Garden .... then headed over to The Christmas Loft where it is Christmas every day of the week! (The kids knew we were going to the farm but had no idea we planned to also go to The Olive Garden for lunch and then back down the road to The Christmas Loft ... it was a nice surprise for them and it was their first visit here.) I know the kids had a great time and Sheila and I also had a great time. Here is a short five minute video with some clips from both Shelburne Farms and The Christmas Loft ... (I ll post some photos soon... even some photos that were shot by Lukey!)
The word "nap" has a bad rap. The way you sleep says a lot about who you are , and many associate napping with toddlers, the elderly, and those who are lazy. Yet, there are tons of great leaders were avid fans of napping. Leonardo da Vinci, for example, took naps every four hours to recharge his intellectual batteries; John F. Kennedy took a noontime siesta every day of his presidency with Jackie by his side ; and workhorse Thomas Edison would often break up his 72-hour work stints with lots of quick snoozes. According to an article by the Harvard Medical School "Results from a New Zealand study published in 2009 showed that air traffic controllers working the night shift scored better on tests of alertness and performance if they took advantage of a planned nap period." Not to mention that a sleep survey performed by The Better Sleep Council uncovered that 48 percent of Americans say they are sleep deprived yet only 34 percent nap regularly. And that makes sense 〞 it's hard to squeeze a nap into our busy days. But did you know a quick 10-minute nap can do wonders? In fact, the amount of time you nap can actually affect you in very different ways. There is actually a nap for every kind of occasion. What's the best type of nap for you ? We've broken it down ＃ The post The Amount Of Time You Nap Can Affect You In Different And Fascinating Ways appeared first on LittleThings.com .
Andy Burnham has pleaded with Labour activists to fight the Tories rather than Tony Blair as the leadership contest enters its last full day. The shadow health secretary used his final full speech of the campaign to issue a thinly-veiled warning about the "credibility" of left-wing frontrunner Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Burnham said: "I have no doubt that, whoever wins, Labour will change quite profoundly, but we need to ensure it is the right kind of change. Change that unites, puts us back in touch with the public and can win a general election. That is what I am offering. Share article "Labour needs a leader ready to fight the Bullingdon Boys, not Tony Blair and the battles of the past. With your support, I will be that leader and give Labour a radical, but credible, Prime Minister-in-waiting." Votes in the contest have to be in by midday tomorrow, with the result due to be announced on Saturday.

(CNN) 每 The Dalai Lama is at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic for medical evaluation, a spokeswoman told CNN on Sunday. Ginger Plumbo declined to talk about why he was there or for how long.

The spiritual leader of the people of Tibet had been scheduled to speak at events in Colorado, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Utah beginning on October 17.

The gardener answered, "Give it one more chance. Leave it another year, and I'll give it special attention and plenty of fertilizer." Luke 13:8 My brother can grow just about anything, and his tomatoes in the summer are especially delicious. On occasion he will share a bounty of tomatoes, and I in turn I pass them to friends to enjoy the fruits of his labor. I am often asked how he gets them to taste so good. Much of what leads to their exceptional quality does not depend on him, but on the right temperature, the soil, and rain. Unlike a summer crop of tomatoes, much of what influences our spiritual life does depend on us. We determine our attitude, our discipline, and our willingness to grow. I check myself from time to time. Am I talking daily to God? Do I trust Him? Am I seeking to grow my relationship with Him? Am I attending worship? Am I seeking spiritual counsel? Am I giving back? I desire to bear exceptional spiritual fruit. I know that means I cannot simply depend on what comes to me. I have to do my part. Application Are your bearing spiritual fruit for God? Prayer Father, help me to feed my soul with your spiritual food, so that I may bear good fruit and honor you. 
The cause of Bobbi Kristina Brown s death has been determined, but the medical examiner s office won t publicly unveil autopsy results because of a court order. The Fulton County Medical Examiner said in a statement Sunday their office is not releasing details because of a Fulton County Superior Court order to seal the results. The 22-year-old Brown died in hospice care July 26. Brown was the only daughter between Bobby Brown and the late Whitney Houston. The Fulton County district attorney and Roswell Police Department have been notified of the findings. Brown was found face-down and unresponsive in a bathtub Jan. 31. She was found in the townhome she shared with Nick Gordon, whom Houston raised as her own. A police report earlier this year described the incident as a drowning.

Home builders tend to assume construction costs will not rise because even if they do go up, home price increases will cover the cost increases.This time might be different, as the dynamics surrounding home price and labor supply are very unrelated. Smart builders are putting big cost increase contingencies in their budgets, which makes land acquisition very challenging, as land sellers are not willing to drop prices.With so much discussion today about the lack of construction labor, despite low levels of construction, and rising construction costs, I want to share some research from our Chief Demographer Chris Porter who projects household formations for us. Chris notes that there has been a 67% decline in immigration from Mexico, and there are 570,000 fewer Mexico-born construction workers than in 2007. We believe many of those 570,000 workers have likely returned to Mexico and will not return to the US construction industry because of:Significantly higher border patrol investmentsAcceleration in court-ordered deportations over the last 7 yearsImplementation of E-Verify technology by employersArizonas SB 1070 bill passing in 2010Economic opportunity in MexicoTo be clear, we are not policy advocates and we are not taking any position on the controversial immigration issue. We just want our clients to realize that many of the 570,000 experienced, Mexico-born construction workers are not likely to return to the US construction industry. Our builder clients are already learning this on the job site today.Burns and Porter assembled a slide deck with their research to illustrate what all of this means.Check it out below, courtesy John Burns Real Estate Consulting.See the rest of the story at Business Insider Click here to read full news..

The Spartans trip to SEC country will be a mid-afternoon affair. Sept. 21, 2015 Birmingham, Ala.----- San Jose State University's October 3 non-conference football game at Auburn University will have a 3:00 p.m. (CT)/1:00 p.m. (PT) start time. The SEC Network will provide the television coverage. The Spartans make a return visit to Jordan-Hare Stadium. Last year, San Jose State lost to 5-Auburn, 59-13, on September 6. Before heading east, the Spartans (1-2, 0-1 Mountain West) host Fresno State (1-2, 0-0 Mountain West), Saturday, September 26, in a 7:30 p.m. (PT) Mountain West conference game at Spartan Stadium.

The number of ATMs across the country has surpassed 70,000 for the first time, the UK s cash machine network Link has reported. Their growing number reflects the essential role that cash continues to play within the UK economy, despite the popularity of technology such as contactless cards and digital payments, Link said. The number of cash machines across the UK reached a new record high of 70,180 in July, tipping over the 70,000 mark for the first time. Some 11.3 billion was withdrawn from ATMs in July, marking a 4% increase compared with July 2014. Share article John Howells, chief executive of Link, said: "Despite cards, contactless payments and digital payments becoming ever more popular, our latest figures show that cash still has a very important place in our purses and wallets. "In fact, 47 million UK adults, or 92% of us, used a cash machine in the UK last year."
Photo: Horcajuelo/Corbis Riccardo Tisci wants you to join his Givenchy fam. Women s Wear Daily reports that the designer is opening up his Givenchy show in New York next week to 1,200 regular Joes. Tisci is working closely with the city on distributing the tickets, 280 of which will go to local fashion students and teachers. While the venue hasn t been announced yet 〞 presumably it s somewhere huge enough to accommodate an arena-size crowd 〞 we do know that perennial Tisci collaborator Marina Abramovic will be involved. It s not Tisci s first flirtation with the concept 〞 during Paris men s week a few months ago, the brand tried announcing its location early on social media to ensure an eager crowd would gather at the venue. CEO Philippe Fortunato called it "a form of rehearsal" for New York Fashion Week. While this seems likely to be a one-off, buzz-generating event, it raises interesting questions about how fashion can open itself up to the public. Whether it s Moschino, Alexander Wang, or Hood by Air, certain Fashion Week shows are always encircled by a rabid following of fans, who, frankly, seem infinitely more excited to be there than most of the industry crowd. What would it mean to harness that enthusiasm? If Tisci s experiment is a success, it could result in a more porous boundary between the still-standoffish fashion industry and the public. That said, it wouldn t be fashion if there weren t some separation between the groups. At next Friday s show, the civilian guests will have their own separate entrance and seating area.
SURAT: Police registered two rioting complaints at Kapodara police station on Saturday evening. Around 4,000 men and women have been booked in each complaint for targeting the police station and blocking Varachha main road to demand release of Hardik Patel, Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) convener, who was detained on Saturday morning.

In the incident at Hira Baug crossroads under Kapodara police station limits, over 4,000 rioters pelted stones at police and blocked Varachha main road. Police arrested one person from the spot.

Deborah Cannada, Librarian - West Side Elementary School, Charleston, WV. Statement by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on the introduction of legislation to repeal the forty percent tax on quality health benefits from the Affordable Care Act: America's working families are encouraged by the bipartisan leadership to improve access to comprehensive health benefits. Passed more than five years ago, the Affordable Care Act's main goal of making health care affordable has remained threatened by an unfair and unnecessary tax on quality care. Legislation like the bills introduced by Senators Dean Heller and Sherrod Brown present important opportunities to work across party lines to improve health care for working people in every state, blue or red. All leaders who support quality, affordable care should join in these efforts. Contact: Josh Goldstein (202) 637-5018 Login to our online community to interact, comment and share.

A 38-year-old man is in a West Australian hospital with suspected self-inflicted knife wounds after he attempted to ram a police car and a firefighting truck. Police say the drama unfolded on Wednesday night on Marine Terrace in Geographe where the knife-wielding man forced them to drive onto a verge to avoid a head-on collision. They claim he then tried to reverse into the police car and drove at the Department of Fire and Emergency Services truck, forcing four employees to jump out of the way to avoid being hit. When police caught him, he had extensive injuries that are believed to be self-inflicted. They say he will be charged.
New Delhi, Sep 3 (IANS) Janata Dal-United president Sharad Yadav said on Thursday that he won t allow the Samajwadi Party to walk out of the Janata Parivar and that everything will be sorted out soon. "Our alliance is intact and will remain intact. I will soon talk to (Samajwadi Party chief) Mulayam Singh Yadav," Sharad Yadav told reporters here. "I just got to know through the media that the Samajwadi Party is not happy with the seat sharing. In a grand alliance such things happen. We will not allow him to walk out of the alliance. Their concerns will be addressed soon," he added. The Samajwadi Party on Thursday walked out of the Janata Parivar and decided to contest the Bihar assembly elections on its own. It pledged to contest on its own "with our full might". Sharad Yadav refused to comment on accusations by Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav that his party had been insulated in Bihar. "I am not going to respond to any of the accusations. We know the problem has come to our doorsteps and we know how to solve it. I have a lot of experiences in resolving such problems," he said. The Janata Dal-United and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) had decided to contest 100 seats each for the 243-member Bihar assembly. The Congress was given 40 seats and the Nationalist Congress Party three. Later, RJD leader Lalu Prasad gave away five seats out of his quota to the Samajwadi Party. --Indo-Asian News Service Published On : Sep 03, 2

I read with an open mind yesterday's N&R article on Saturday's downtown Greensboro Peace Festival. Mind you the print edition headline shouted from the rooftops that the festival was a response to an incident of hate: FROM HATE TO PEACE A hate letter galvanized Greensboro into hosting the first peace festival downtown Ok, bad stuff I think to myself as I start reading: The letter that sparked the responses arrived at the Islamic Center during Ramadan, a holy month of fasting, introspection and prayer held in late June and early July. The writer said he was a business owner and had worked hard to establish a successful business in Greensboro. But he had received many complaints from customers concerned about Muslims being close to the property. It asked that the Muslim community be "less visible." Qureshi did the unexpected. He went to the business owner to talk with him about the letter. It turned out that the owner had not sent it. I can understand Mr. Qureshi taking offense to the letter 〞-whoever wrote it〞 but does it represent out and out hate? Maybe I'm naive, but I didn't see it. And the N&R Republicans are divisive.

WHILE the Australian manuka honey industry is still in its infancy, there is encouraging news from across the Tasman, where astounding growth in global demand for the medical honey has reached new heights. New Zealand honey products exporter Manuka Health has been sold to Australian equity giant Pacific Equity Partners. It is believed the purchase price was $110 million - more than five times the $20 million valuation placed on the company in 2012 when Auckland investment firm Waterman Capital bought a 20% stake in the wellness business. Founded in 2006 by Kerry Paul, Manuka Health sells its products - including honey, propolis and royal jelly - in more than 45 countries. It has annual sales of about $70 million, up from $17 million in 2012. Waterman director Chris Marshall said the company was pleased with the outcome of the investment. "The company has grown at an extraordinary pace and delivered an outstanding return to our investors," Mr Marshall said. "We are similarly pleased that our skills and capital have been of assistance in achieving such a satisfying outcome." Since 2012 Manuka has enjoyed growth, including building a $10 million processing facility in Te Awamutu and a quadrupling of staff numbers. Capilano Honey, based in Brisbane, is working on growing its manuka enterprise at Evans Head. More on that next week.

WESTLAND, Mich. (WXYZ) - A metro Detroit mom searched for her young child in a panic when he vanished from school today. Alicia Thomspson is thankful to have her son home safe, after the traumatic ordeal. For Thompson and her 4-year-old son CJ, the end of the school day was the start of a scary experience. As class let out just before 4:00 pm at Edison Elementary, Thompson says she arrived to pick up CJ - who was nowhere to be found. The school couldn t tell Thompson where her 4-year-old son actually was and the confusion lasted nearly 2 hours. She says a kindergarten teacher was the last one to see CJ and thought he d left with an adult he was familiar with. Almost 2 hours later, a bus driver found CJ, who was the last kid still riding around, police were contacted and CJ, who luckily knew his mom s phone number, was then returned back home. While CJ can still smile and even point out where he was sitting on some of his own artwork, his mom wants to make sure this never happens again - to her or anyone else. The Wayne Westland Schools Superintendent says they are investigating this incident closely and will take all steps necessary to ensure safety of students.

West Ham have been fined 50,000 and warned over their future conduct following the behaviour of their players after midfielder Mark Noble s dismissal at Liverpool last month. Noble, who scored the second goal in his side s 3-0 Barclays Premier League victory at Anfield on August 29, was sent off in the 78th minute when referee Kevin Friend judged him to have fouled Danny Ings. That decision was overturned on September 2, after Noble had insisted his challenge was not even worthy of a yellow card and manager Slaven Bilic was equally critical. However, the Football Association charged the London club over the reaction of Noble s team-mates following Friend s decision and a statement from the governing body on Friday evening read: "Following an independent regulatory commission hearing, West Ham United have been fined 50,000 and warned as to their future conduct after an FA player misconduct charge brought against the club was found proven. "It was alleged that in or around the 78th minute of the game against Liverpool on 29 August 2015, West Ham failed to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion. Share article "The club had admitted the charge and submitted a plea for mitigation." Noble will be available for the Hammers game against Newcastle at Upton Park on Monday, when the Hammers could also welcome three of their deadline-day signings - Victor Moses, Michail Antonio and Nikica Jelavic - into their squad.
After MondayaEUR(TM)s trading in Spectra Energy Corp (http://www.marketintelligencecenter.com/symbol/SE"SE) MarketIntelligenceCenter.com s patented algorithms uncovered a trade that offers a 6.34% return or 21.44% on an annualized basis (for comparison purposes only), while providing 6.19% downside protection. The trade is a Dec. 15 covered call at the $29.00 level for a net debit of about $27.27. The net debit is also the breakeven point for this trade. For a higher return, consider buying a longer-term call option, like the Jan. 17 at the $20.00 level. By buying the call for $9.40 instead of paying about $29.07 for the stock, the assigned return rate for this alternate trade is 18.42%, but the stock has to finish above $27.60 when the sold call expires for this trade to be profitable. Standard & PooraEUR(TM)s has a 4 STARS (out of 5) buy ranking on Spectra Energy. Technical indicators for the stock have been bearish and support and resistance have been in the area of $27.64 and $29.94, respectively.

If you've been longing for a new Android phone with a physical keyboard, BlackBerry's got what you need. BlackBerry has announced that it's working on an Android phone called the "BlackBerry Priv." The Priv will be BlackBerry's first Android phone, with a launch expected to take place in late 2015. BlackBerry hasn't spilled any of the Priv's spec details, but the company describes it as a "flagship slider device." So why go Android? BlackBerry CEO John Chen explains: "At the same time, we are focused on making faster progress to achieve profitability in our handset business. Today, I am confirming our plans to launch Priv, an Android device named after BlackBerry's heritage and core mission of protecting our customers' privacy. Priv combines the best of BlackBerry security and productivity with the expansive mobile application ecosystem available on the Android platform." It sounds like BlackBerry isn't happy with how its own BlackBerry 10 devices are improving its bottom line, so it decided to turn to Android to give its profitability a boost. Whether or not the Priv will do that remains to be seen, but Android is the biggest mobile OS in the world and Android phones that have a physical keyboard are basically non-existent, so there's a chance that the Priv could do well for BlackBerry. Will you buy a BlackBerry Priv? from Android and Me http://ift.tt/1Fy3O3g via IFTTT
My parents first introduced me to Wayne Dyer s teachings in the 1980s. I continue to still read his old and new stuff.....With gratitude, and in memoriam.... We lost a great leader and teacher in Dr. Wayne Dyer. Here are a few of his thoughts..... When you dance, your purpose is not to get to a certain place on the floor. It s to enjoy each step along the way. How people treat you is their karma; how you react is yours. Be miserable. Or motivate yourself. Whatever has to be done, it s always your choice. Go for it now. The future is promised to no one. Love is the ability and willingness to allow those that you care for to be what they choose for themselves without any insistence that they satisfy you. Doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life. When you judge another, you do not define them, you define yourself. It is impossible for you to be angry and laugh at the same time. Anger and laughter are mutually exclusive and you have the power to choose either. A mind at peace, a mind centered and not focused on harming others, is stronger than any physical force in the universe. The highest form of ignorance is when you reject something you don t know anything about. You cannot always control what goes on outside. But you can always control what goes on inside. -Wayne Dyer

The Eye Opener The Eye Opener Monday, Sept. 7, 2015 Remember those days when you walked around with a chip on your shoulder - daring any and all the hostile world to knock it off? Well, they did knock it off, and you were beaten and kicked at every turn. You were constantly fighting alcohol, and people, and things. The day finally came when you had had enough; you were beaten to your knees; the chips toppled from your shoulder when you surrendered, and your burdens became lighter at once. Actually you had only been fighting yourself all the time. Hazelden Foundation
MINSK, Sept 22, 2015: One of the world's strongest man is so strong that he single-handedly managed to stop two planes from taking off with just his brute strength. Belarusian power-lifter Kirill Shimko showed superhuman strength when he managed to simultaneously pull two Yak-52 planes, which have a combined weight of around 2.5 tonnes. According to Rt.com , the 37-year old Shimco performed his feat on an airfield in Minsk by taking hold of ropes which were attached to two Yakovlev Yak-52 trainer aircraft that were attempting to take off. However, the 130 kg strongman managed to prevent the planes from doing so. Previously, he has performed other feats of strength, which are in the Guinness Book of Records . In 2009, he and his friend Pavel Soroka managed to pull a 31-tonne T-34 tank. They also managed to move an Ilyushin Il-76 strategic airlifter which weighs about 150 tonnes, a 118-tonne crane and a 55-tonne truck. Two years ago, he managed to pull a WW2-era 11.5-tonne tank.

Tweet Pin It Look, there are dope rides, there are custom rides, and then there are the legends. Today we get a look at a legend, an iconic, eye-catching and rather unique ride that rocks some amazing qualities and stunning design. Today we get a look at a 1969 Lamborghini Islero S Coupe. This outstanding and rather pristine example comes rocking quite a history. The ride was one that Sir Roger Moore, who grabbed the James Bond torch from Sean Connery, drove this car in the film 'The Man Who Haunted Himself'. The ride was completely restored in 1986, and kept in top condition ever since. We find a burgundy leather interior, clean and pristine, while a 4.0-liter V12 engine makes for one powerful classic ride!

A second suspect has been arrested in connection with the August 17 bombing at Bangkok s Erawan Shrine that killed more than 20 people and injured dozens of others, police said Tuesday. The unidentified man was arrested in Thailand near the Thai-Cambodian border as he tried to cross illegally, according to national police spokesman Lt. Gen. Prawut Thavornsiri. The suspect is a foreigner and speaks English, he said. When asked about surveillance video of the bombing that identified the chief suspect as wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark-framed glasses, Prawut said the arrested man s identity still had to be verified. The man is connected to the bombing and is "very important," he added. The suspect is also linked to an explosion heard near a Bangkok pier the next day, Prawut said. The blast ripped through crowds gathered near the shrine, killing 22 people and reportedly injuring about 120. In one closed-circuit television image released by police, a man carries a dark-colored backpack near the shrine. Police said he hid a backpack with a pipe bomb underneath a bench. The shrine, at a bustling intersection near a large shopping mall, is a big draw for tourists. At least seven people from other Asian countries were reported to be among the dead as well as one Briton. The site is popular among Buddhists as well as Hindu and Sikh members of Thailand s Indian community. Police had arrested one man on Saturday and issued warrants for two other people.
The United Nations says Europe must offer guaranteed relocation for Syrian refugees. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) says around one million migrants should reach Europe by the end of 2016. Some 30,000 refugees and migrants are on Greek islands now, including 20,000 on Lesbos. Record numbers are crossing from Greece into the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from where many people board trains heading for Serbia. The UNHCR said that reception centres must be set up in countries including Greece and Hungary to deal with the influx of people. Hundreds of people wait in this reception area under the watchful eye of Hungarian police . It's become a bottleneck for migrants and refugees who have travelled from Greece through the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia before reaching Hungary. Hungary has refused offers of help from the United Nations refugee agency. Its holding area is an ill-equipped open corn-field where newcomers, will sleep before taken to already overcrowded transit camps.

click to enlarge Okay, I m not going to lie... I m not ready to let go of summer. I like pumpkin spice in my coffee, but not yet. I love pumpkin beers, but come see me next month with that noise. This week, I bring you my It s-Not-Fall-to-Me-Dammit cocktail. I guess the name is a work in progress, but the drink isn t. And last I checked, it s still hot as hell outside. Lemon Ginger-Pepper Cocktail Makes 1 Ginger-Pepper Simple Syrup: 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup water 1 nob of fresh ginger, cut into thin 1-inch slices Whole peppercorns (ground peppercorns work, too) In a small saucepan, combine water and sugar over medium-high heat. Stir until sugar is fully dissolved, then turn down heat to simmer. Add in ginger alongside 10-15 whole peppercorns. Allow syrup to simmer for 15-20 minutes. Strain and pour into a covered jar before refrigerating. The syrup will last for at least a month. Cocktail: 3 ounces gin 1.5 ounces ginger-pepper simple syrup, or to taste Lemonade Lemon wedge Fill a Collins glass, or a pint glass if you re not trying to be all fancy-like, with ice and add gin. (I used Farmer s Organic Gin since I had it on hand, and it pairs well with lemon.) Add the ginger-pepper syrup before topping with lemonade and a squeeze of fresh lemon. Combine in a cocktail shaker, pour back into the glass and enjoy. Follow @cfasick on Twitter.

David Busst has offered Manchester United and England left-back Luke Shaw hope of a return to action before the end of the season. Former Coventry defender Busst suffered a horrific leg break against United at Old Trafford in 1996 after colliding with Denis Irwin and Brian McClair and retired from the game a few months later. Busst needed 26 operations and contracted the MRSA virus but he is confident 20-year-old Shaw, who sustained a double fracture of his right leg in Tuesday night s 2-1 defeat at PSV Eindhoven, will make a full recovery. He told The Sun: "It wasn t the actual fractures that stopped me from playing, it was the infections. "But so long as it s a clean break and there is no infection, there shouldn t be a major issue for Luke."

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African court on Wednesday rejected the state s bid to appeal a ruling that authorities had erred in letting Sudan s President Omar Hassan al-Bashir leave the country despite a court order barring him from doing so, a radio station said. Judge Hans Fabricius, supported by two other judges, said Bashir did not enjoy diplomatic immunity against a global arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), Talk Radio 702 reported. Bashir, who was in South Africa for an African Union (AU) summit in June, was allowed to depart for Khartoum even though a Pretoria court had issued an order banning him from leaving. President Jacob Zuma last month defended the government s failure to detain Bashir, saying that the wanted leader had immunity as a guest of the AU. The opposition Democratic Alliance party, which sponsored a failed motion in parliament to set up an ad hoc committee to investigate the president for possible impeachment over his role in the saga, welcomed the court s ruling against the appeal. The ICC has since asked Zuma s government to explain its decision to ignore the arrest warrant before October 5.
Neogen Corporation announced that revenues for the first quarter of its 2016 fiscal year, which ended Aug. 31, were $74,860,000 - an 11% increase compared to revenues of $67,599,000 in the first quarter of last year. First quarter net income increased 5% to $9,323,000, or $0.25 per share, from the previous year s first quarter income of $8,883,000, or $0.24 a share. The revenues and net income represent first quarter records for the 33-year-old company. "We are pleased to report a solid start to our new fiscal year, despite facing the same currency headwinds that all U.S. companies with significant international sales have been facing in recent months," said James Herbert, Neogen s chief executive officer and chairman. "We were able to complete two strategic acquisitions in the quarter, while building our core business through broad-based increases in sales across many of our diverse product lines and market segments." The first quarter was the 94th of the past 99 quarters that Neogen reported revenue increases compared with the previous year - including all consecutive quarters in the last 10 years. [ Go Back ]
(Before It s News) On Tuesday, University of Delaware Acting President Nancy M. Targett (pictured above) responded to reports that nooses had been found on the college campus. Targett wasted no time reassuring locals that police action and prompt investigations were taking place, and that hatred and intolerance has no place on the university's campus. "This is a despicable act of hatred and it's been perpetrated by what we think are one or a few individuals," she said. "We are both saddened and disturbed that this deplorable act has taken place on our campus＃We condemn this despicable action and ask everyone in our community to stand together against intolerance and hate," she added. Targett's comments were quickly accepted as fact and reported as news across the country. Her account was even reportedly broadcast by an NBC affiliate in Chicago. But the hate crime turned out to be a rush to judgment when it was revealed that the supposed nooses were actually chording from Chinese lanterns. The nooses were not nooses at all. Wednesday, a day after the fiery rush to judgment, The University of Delaware tweeted out the truth that the racist nooses were actually "remnants of paper lanterns." Targett tweeted that the "incident was not a hate crime". Could Targett have prevented this mistake? How should she handle reports of racism in the future?

Making it easier for customers to perform tillage adjustments with the push of a button, John Deere introduces TruSet. This technology enables users to independently adjust depth or pressure settings for each operation on their 2730 Combination Ripper from the cab, on-the-go, for maximum agronomic results."As conditions change throughout the field, operators running the 2730 with TruSet can quickly and efficiently respond to varying soils, compacted areas, heavier residue, and moisture," said Nathan Kramer, product marketing manager for John Deere. "Making customized adjustments that respond to these agronomic factors help customers maximize their yield potential."With TruSet, operators can adjust depth settings for their disks, rippers, and closing disks on the 2730 Ripper along with pressure settings for the active hydraulic rolling baskets. These adjustments are made in cab from the GreenStar 3 2630 Display that also provides users with real-time data for their actual tillage settings."In just six seconds, TruSet operators can adjust depth and pressure settings from the cab while continuing to cover acres," Kramer said.Operators no longer have to sacrifice machine performance by deciding to forgo manual adjustments throughout the field. At the touch of a button, TruSet users can quickly respond to changing conditions such as running deeper over end rows or working shallower on hilltops and lighter soils.TruSet's four memory set points allow operators to save settings for their most common field conditions. Operators can also make adjustments on the display to achieve their desired field finish.

As we announced a few days ago, Inkwell Ideas is starting up a Patreon campaign to fund additional icons and continued development for all of our software. To show you what you'll get, we will be releasing a few new sample icons for each program over the next few days. Each month we'll put together at least one pack of 15+ icons for each of our 4 programs. (60+ icons in all, and some months we may do two packs of 60+ icons each.) Plus, some icons can be used in multiple tools. You can pledge at a level matching the perks you want and any number of our programs. First up are these samples for our dungeon/building interior designer Dungeonographer : Above, we have a scroll with a symbol, a skeleton token, a dark circular table, and a dark circular table with place settings. This should give you an idea of the art we're providing. To use them in Dungeonographer, save them to your computers, then open a map in the program, go to the "Map Items" right sidebar, scroll down to the "import map items" button or the "mass import map items" button and follow the file chooser. But the are also PNG images, scaled so that 300 pixels = 5∪, so you're free to use them in general image editors or any programs that let you use PNGs. 
Bulgarian Defense Minister Nikolay Nenchev. Photo by BGNES Bulgarian Defense Minister Nikolay Nenchev has warned the country s army will need hundreds of millions of BGN for current expenses over the next few years. Citing the mid-term budget forecast for 2016-2018, Nenchev has warned that the move to increase the minimum salary next year will require BGN 58 M (EUR 29 M) more until 2018 and BGN 150 M to boost defense capabilities under a modernization program, BGNES wire service quotes him as saying. Another BGN 100 M have to be earmarked to pay back debts of the Military Medical Academy, a hospital which was plagued by a financial scandal earlier this year. Nenchev has repeated several times over the last year that the army hasn t been allocated enough funding under the 2015 budget framework. His call has also been backed by President Rosen Plevneliev , who is one of the staunchest advocates of boosting defense spending in line with NATO requirements. Prime Minister Boyko Borisov , however, is adamant that increasing military expenditures will not be possible before next year.

SAN ANTONIO, TX .- Mart赤n Gutierrezs music videos, four of which are shown at the McNay Art Museum , explore self-transformation and the intersection of fantasy and reality. His videos subvert typical gender tropes, thereby forcing viewers to come to their own conclusions. In Clubbing, a video from Gutierrezs undergraduate years, the artist plays multiple characters, both male and female, in a bid to supplant ideas of traditional identity. Trio appears to display Gutierrezs form inserted in a bleak desert landscape. The artist manipulates images of his figurein triplicatein order to arouse in the viewer questions of identity and reality. Both Blame the Rain and If feature the character Martine, Gutierrezs singer persona. These works examine the status of celebrity, media, and subculture through videos that are written, sung, and produced by Gutierrez alone. The artist describes these music videos as explorations on the theme of pop singer Lana del Rey goes to the Caribbean and is still sad. Mart赤n Gutierrez was born in 1989 in Berkeley, California, to an American mother and Guatemalan father, and as an adolescent moved to rural Vermont. The artist received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2012. Gutierrez is based in Brooklyn, New York. His work has been featured in numerous publications, including the Daily Beast, New York Times, New York Magazine, and Paper Magazine.
(CNNMoney) - Leonardo DiCaprio has joined a growing consortium of investors that is breaking ranks with fossil fuels. The movie star tweeted that he joined the ranks of Divest Invest. And he s not alone. The divestment movement, according to a report from Arabella Advisors, has grown to 2,040 individuals and 436 institutions from 43 countries representing $2.6 trillion in assets. This is a dramatic increase from the last Arabella report in September 2014, when Divest Invest had 181 institutions and 656 individuals representing $50 billion. The investors pledge to separate their portfolios from any exposure to fossil fuel assets in what they call a "carbon constrained world." The investors are also supposed to increase their stake in clean energy companies. The prime motivator for the movement is to reduce the human impact on climate change and global warming. DiCaprio s Twitter account is chock full of references to clean air and melting sea ice. Nearly 20 years ago, the "Titanic" star established the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation "with the mission of protecting the world s last wild places" and a focus on climate change. He is designated United Nations Messenger of Peace for Climate Change. He stars in the upcoming "Revenant," a bloody epic about a frontiersman who gets mauled by a bear.

By Gabriela Baczynska, Tom Perry, Laila Bassam and Phil Stewart MOSCOW/BEIRUT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian forces have begun participating in military operations in Syria in support of government troops, three Lebanese sources familiar with the political and military situation there said on Wednesday. The sources, speaking to Reuters on condition they not be identified, gave the most forthright account yet from the region of what U.S. officials say appears to be a new military buildup by Moscow, one of President Bashar al-Assad s main allies, though one of the sources said the numbers of Russians involved so far were small. Two U.S. officials said Russia has sent two tank landing ships and additional aircraft to Syria in the past day or so and has deployed a small number of naval infantry forces.
Many investors build their portfolio without any meaningful positions in preferred stock. The iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (PFF) is one quick solution to that problem. Expense Ratio The expense ratio on the ETF is .47%. I d really prefer to see a lower expense ratio with long term holdings since the nature of preferred stock suggests positions would not need to be changed frequently. When I pulled up the turnover ratio for the portfolio, it was coming up as 13%. That is higher than I would have expected but not high enough that I would expect the high expense ratio to be necessary. This may simply be a case of an ETF in a niche market having a long track record (established in 2007) and high volume (over 3 million shares per day) being a position where it can demand a higher expense ratio. Largest Holdings The largest holdings of the ETF show a heavy concentration towards the financial sectors. It isn t just the top 10 though, as you ll see in the next section. The sector exposure for PFF is heavily concentrated on banks and "Diversified Financials." Sector The sector exposure is extremely concentrated and that would be an area of concern for me. Since my goals in using preferred shares within a portfolio would be to diversify the risk factors for the portfolio, I would prefer to only need one ETF of preferred stock and to have that ETF bring in a substantially lower level of concentration.

Support services and construction group Interserve has been awarded a 12.3m contract by Leeds City Council to improve and refurbish the historic grade I-listed Kirkgate Market. Located in the heart of the city, the existing market attracts more than 35,000 shoppers per week. The work is expected to last until August 2016 although will remain "business as usual" for the 200 permanent traders located within the indoor market as well as the 150 on the open market. John Gittins, divisional director of Interserve, said: "There are a number of challenges with completing work around a live retail environment. To mitigate these, we have already undertaken some initial enabling works and will complete some of the work outside trading hours to minimise disruption. "As the building is listed, we will be working closely with English Heritage and the conservation team. "Presently, approximately 1,750 people are employed at the Leeds Kirkgate Market and this project will create a number of additional local jobs, apprenticeships and training opportunities." The redevelopment will include maintenance to and renewal of the 1976 and 1981 halls, plus pedestrian routes linking the George St, New York St and Vicar Lane entrances. Councillor Richard Lewis, Leeds City Council s executive member responsible for regeneration, transport and planning, said: "Kirkgate Market is a prime retail location with a major historical and cultural significance for Leeds, so it is only right that we invest in its future now to make it a sustainable and 'go to' destination for generations to come."
A tree stands in a deforested area in the middle of the Amazon jungle during a flight by Greenpeace activists over areas of illegal exploitation of timber, in the state of Para, Brazil, on October 14, 2014 Two major UN conferences on climate change and sustainable development must tackle the key issue of deforestation, the World Forestry Congress urged Friday. "Forests are an essential solution to climate change adaptation and mitigation," according to a statement released by the congress, which drew 4,000 delegates from government, conservation groups and the private sector to the South African city of Durban this week. Apart from offering oxygen, fuel and building material, trees store important quantities of carbon gas, which, if released, contribute to global warming. Members of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are due to meet in Paris from November 30 to December 11, bidding for a landmark agreement to curb carbon emissions. "Climate change poses a serious threat to the planet and to forests and forest-dependent people, and there is a risk that actions will fall short of what is required," the congress said. The Durban meeting also targeted the UN General Assembly summit in New York later this month on adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. MORE of the story / click image TOP of PAGE
TORONTO 每 A 65-year-old man and a 9-year-old boy are dead following a multi-vehicle collision in Vaughan, Ont. on Sunday. York Regional Police said a vehicle carrying six people, three adults and three children under the age of 10, was struck by another vehicle at the intersection of Kipling Avenue and Kirby Road at approximately 4:10 p.m ET northeast of Kleinburg. "It's a very serious collision scene," said Const. Andy Pattenden. The male inside the vehicle died at the scene and two women were rushed to hospital with serious injuries. Both remain in stable condition and are expected to survive. Police said three children, all under the age of 10, were also taken to hospital in life-threatening condition where the 9-year-old later succumbed to his injuries. Police say the lone driver of one of the vehicles, a 29-year-old man from King Township, has been arrested for impaired driving. He's expected to make a court appearance on Monday. Two occupants of a third vehicle involved in the crash were unharmed. Police said the major collision unit is investigating the crash and are asking for any witnesses to come forward.
Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel tells officials she plans to fly a World Trade Center memorial flag at the German Chancellery in honor of the 37 police officers with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey who died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Port Authority police spokesman Joe Pentangelo (pehn-TAN -jeh-loh) says Merkel visited the 9/11 memorial site at the World Trade Center on Saturday. Inspector Ron Shindel, who speaks German, greeted Merkel and presented her with the World Trade Center memorial flag and a police challenge coin. Merkel told police officials she plans to fly the flag at the chancellery, which is home to Germany s federal government. A spokesman for the Permanent Mission of Germany to the United Nations didn t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
A Washington man passed away at the scene of a vehicle accident on Saturday near Yreka. The California Highway Patrol reported in a press release on Monday that Kaylen Solomon, 19, Erin Solomon, 41 and Raelynn Solomon, 18, all of Deming, Washington, were traveling northbound on Interstate 5 at approximately 7:50 a.m. on Saturday, with Raelynn Solomon at the wheel. The release states that as the vehicle passed the north Yreka exit to State Route 3, the driver allowed the vehicle to drift onto the dirt center divider at approximately 80 miles per hour. She attempted to correct the course of the vehicle, turning the wheel sharply to the right. The vehicle swerved across both northbound lanes and overturned multiple times, ejecting Erin Solomon from the vehicle. Both he and the vehicle came to a rest on the east roadway shoulder, the release states. Raelynn and Kaylen were both taken to Fairchild Medical Center to be treated for their injuries, but Erin succumbed to his injuries at the scene. No alcohol or controlled substances are suspected of being involved in the accident, the release states, but none of the occupants had been wearing their safety belts.
The big question hanging over markets right now is the Federal Reserve. Will the Fed raise interest rates in September? October? December? Never? But for all of the hand-wringing about when the Fed's first move comes, monetary policy around the world is still very, very easy. Take, for example, Mario Draghi's comments earlier on Thursday that the European Central Bank is ready to act if Europe's economy falters. In a note to clients earlier this week, Morgan Stanley wrote that, "despite some differentiation in the direction of policy decisions both across and within regions, global monetary policy should remain very expansionary as central banks continue to provide support for the prevailing trend of weak aggregate demand."

2:01 PM ARLINGTON, Va. 〞 Navy Secretary Ray Mabus has named the next Freedom-variant littoral combat ship Minneapolis/St. Paul (LCS 21), the Defense Department said in a Sept. 3 release. The future Minneapolis/St. Paul was named to honor the citizens of Minnesota's Twin Cities who have a long and proud history of naval service. It will be the second ship to bear the name. The first, a submarine, was commissioned in 1984. A fast, agile surface combatant, the LCS provides the required war fighting capabilities and operational flexibility to execute a variety of missions in areas such as mine warfare, anti-submarine warfare and surface warfare. Minneapolis/St. Paul will be built with modular design incorporating mission packages that can be changed out quickly as combat needs change in a region. These mission packages are supported by detachments that deploy both manned and unmanned vehicles, and sensors in support of mine, undersea, and surface warfare missions. The ship will be 388 feet long and capable of traveling at speeds in excess of 40 knots. The construction will be led by a Lockheed Martin industry team in Marinette, Wis.
Tajikistan News.Net Thursday 3rd September, 2015 DoNER Minister Jitendra Singh on Thursday said maximum central assistance will be extended to Arunachal Pradesh to expedite various development projects in the northeastern state. The minister for the Development of the North Eastern Region (DoNER) said this during a meeting with Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Nabam Tuki who called on him here, according to an official statement. Jitendra Singh said Rs.30 crore was the budget for the construction of an RCC bridge over Pachin river that would connect the upcoming inter-state bus terminal (ISBT) at Nirjuli near state capital Itanagar with Naharlagun railway station. The DoNER minister also said Rs.25 crore would be needed for road connectivity in the capital complex with bypass roads. When Tuki requested the setting up of a high court complex at Itanagar, Jitendra Singh said the secretariat and legislature buildings were already being funded by the DoNER ministry and only after the completion of these two projects, the funding for a high court complex could be contemplated, if feasible. The union minister said the DoNER ministry would try to work out the feasibility of funding the proposed Rs.150-crore multi-purpose sports stadium at Itanagar, while work on an airport would also be taken up soon. Considering the high potential of the state and its scenic attributes, the government has also sanctioned a film institute in the state, Jitendra Singh said. He appreciated the people of Arunachal Pradesh for showing patience in the wake of some incidents of law and order in the northeast. Tuki also sought the intervention of the DoNER minister to carry forward the work of an important road linking Seppa with Chayang Tajo.
Tom Brady is not only Donald Trump s golfing buddy. The New England Patriot endorsed The Donald for president Wednesday. When Brady was asked about a "Make American Great Again" hat that was previously spotted in his locker, he said the hat is a "nice keepsake" and that it would be "great" if Trump won the election. When asked if Trump has a shot at winning the general election, Brady said, "I hope so. That would be great. There d be a putting green on the White House lawn. I know that." When asked if he has any advice to Trump before the CNN Republican debate tonight, Brady simply said, "No." Trump has been a longtime ally of Brady and fiercely defended him during the "Deflategate" scandal.
SINGAPORE: Formula One world championship leader Lewis Hamilton retired from the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday after encountering power problems in his Mercedes. The British driver, who had not suffered a retirement this season, eventually drove into the pits at the end of lap 32. Hamilton, the reigning world drivers champion, was riding in fourth having picked up a place from his third row starting position when he complained over his team radio about issues with his car, which has dominated this year. "Lost power guys, lost power," Hamilton said over the radio on lap 26 before tumbling down the field as his team tried in vain to figure out the cause of the problem. The Briton, who has a 53-point lead in the championship over team mate Nico Rosberg with six races remaining after Singapore, fell to 16th over the next laps before his team opted to call him in. Hamilton has enjoyed mixed fortunes under the floodlights of the Marina Bay Street Circuit, winning twice in 2009 and last year but also being forced to retire when leading in 2012 with former team McLaren. Ferrari s Sebastian Vettel led after 35 laps of the 61 lap race with Rosberg in fourth. Follow TOI Sports on Twitter @TOISportsNews

Speed bumps are widely regarded as a pain, so it may come as no surprise that, according to researchers from Oxford University, they can be used to diagnose acute appendicitis. The British scientists who made the discovery have been recognised in this year s Ig Nobel awards, presented for achievements that make people "laugh, then think". Dr Helen Ashdown, from Oxford University, and her team showed that a yelp of pain as a patient was being driven over speed bumps was indicative of acute appendicitis. The speed bump test picked up 97% of people with the condition, but was less good at avoiding "false positive" identification of those who were free of the complaint. Writing in the British Medical Journal, the researchers concluded: "Presence of pain while travelling over speed bumps was associated with an increased likelihood of acute appendicitis. "As a diagnostic variable, it compared favourably with other features commonly used in clinical assessment .. "Speed bumps may have a useful alternative benefit in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis." The Ig Nobel awards, from the spoof scientific journal Annals of Improbable Research, were presented at a ceremony at Harvard University in the US last night. They are intended to parody the Nobel prizes due to be announced next month. Other Ig Nobels were awarded for studies fitting chickens with prosthetic "dinosaur tails", looking at the plausibility of a Moroccan emperor fathering 888 children, and discovering the most painful bee sting points on the body.

Splosion Man developer becomes an independent studio again. Splosion Man creator Twisted Pixel is no longer a Microsoft-owned studio, having returned to its roots as an independent developer. The developer was acquired by Microsoft in 2011 shortly after the release of Xbox 360 Kinect title The Gunstringer. It later released the poorly-received 2013 Xbox One action-racer Lococycle directly under Microsoft. It isn t yet clear, however, why the studio broke away from Microsoft, or which of the two parties made the decision. "This transition has been in the works for a few months, with both parties working together to lay the groundwork for us to spin out and become independent again," Twisted Pixel s executive producer Bill Muehl said in a statement seen by IGN . "We re looking forward to the new relationships and platforms this will open up to us and continuing our strong partnership with Microsoft on future titles for their platforms." Twisted Pixel s next project has yet to be announced. Source: ign.com
Sean Penn and Lee Daniels *Sean Penn has filed a $10 million lawsuit against "Empire" co-creator Lee Daniels for accusing him of hitting women 〞 and doing so in an attempt to downplay Terrence Howard's past domestic violence allegations. Howard admitted to Rolling Stone magazine that he hit his two ex-wives. Commenting on Howard's admission, Daniels told The Hollywood Reporter, "That poor boy. He ain't done nothing different than Marlon Brando or Sean Penn, and all of a sudden he's some f***in' demon＃. That's a sign of the time, of race, of where we are right now in America." Penn claims in his lawsuit Daniels' comments were "reckless and malicious" and Sean has falsely "for years been the subject of scandalous, scurrilous, and baseless attacks." Per TMZ : Penn has been caught on video attacking paparazzi and prosecuted for it. As for women, there have been numerous reports that he allegedly brutalized Madonna in the late '80s, and numerous publications reported he was charged and convicted. We did some checking, and it appears the story about being charged and convicted is incorrect ＃ he was never charged. Penn says in the lawsuit, "Daniels' defense of Howard (and his improper invocation of two of the greatest actors and humanitarians of our time, Brando and Penn, in doing so) is apparently part of a misguided campaign to profit and further bolster and brand his show 'Empire.

Paris prosecutors have opened a preliminary investigation into French government accusations that Syrian President Bashar Assad s government has committed crimes against humanity. The prosecutor s office said Wednesday the investigation is based on photos taken by a former Syrian officer who fled in 2013 and focuses on atrocities allegedly committed between 2011 and 2013. It comes as Russia, a key Assad ally, is trying to rally an international action against Islamic State extremists in Syria, and some western voices are softening their positions against Assad because of mounting violence by the extremists. France remains staunchly opposed to Assad. The probe, opened this month, is in its earliest stages, prosecutor s office spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said. It is unclear who might eventually be charged and whether French investigators would travel to war-torn Syria.

MANCHESTER UNITED and Manchester City face a potential fixture disaster after both were drawn at home in the Capital One Cup. Policing issues restrict both from playing at home on the same evening, leaving one outfit facing heavy fixture congestion in late October. The fourth round clashes of the League Cup will take place on either 27th or 28th October and cannot be moved to Sunday 31 because of Premier League and European commitments. GETTY TASK: Man United or Man City will have to play two games in three days at the end of October United face Middlesbrough at Old Trafford, while Manchester City entertain Crystal Palace having both cruised through the third round. To make matters worse, the Manchester derby is scheduled for October 25 - meaning one team will be forced to play two games in three days. The news of a fixture pile-up will not please United boss Louis van Gaal who faces a defensive crisis after injuries to Marcos Rojo, Paddy McNair and Luke Shaw. GETTY FIT: Wayne Rooney has only just returned from injury REUTERS DERBY: The Manchester derby is scheduled for October 27 LVG will be forced to field a makeshift defence against Sunderland on Saturday and perhaps deploy Ashley Young at left-back. When asked whether Rojo would be fit enough to return for the visit of Dick Advocaat s side, the Van Gaal said: "No. The left-footed players, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo, are injured, so I have a problem." It will also be an unwelcome obstacle for Manuel Pellegrini as City s recent defeat to Juventus leaves them needing Champions League points.

Over in the UK, they have different adverts. Despite massive globalisation, not every brand has made it everywhere, and thus the local brands need to advertise their wares locally. Premier Inn are a hotel chain that don't exist in SA (I guess you'd compare them to an slightly upmarket City Lodge), and so obviously, neither does the Premier Inn advert. The advert is ok. You can see it here . I wonder how much Lenny Henry got paid for his role? I could have done that. For less. But the music is properly nice 每 it's Katie "Loads of bikes in Peking" Melua with her cover of Black's 1987 hit Wonderful Life . Very gentle. Very smooth. And it's supporting children's hospital charities in the UK, including the one in Sheffield where I had my tonsils out and my left elbow reset (in entirely separate events). So, you know, if your Randelas can stretch that far, go and find it on iTunes as well.
Now I am a great fan of William Morris. For years we had his wallpaper up in our hall, I have reproductions of some of his work and have read News From Nowhere,but I never visited his house in Bexleyheath. But this Sunday courtesy of Heritage Week I could pay the place a call. Heritage Week is the one week in the year where plenty of historical buildings and gardens usually closed to the public are open for inspection. And so it is with Red House,* which offers "free entry to William Morris house, founder of the Arts and Crafts movement. The only house he commissioned, created and lived in, Red House is a building of extraordinary architectural and social significance which is set amongst a wonderful garden in the midst of suburbia. Entry to the house will be on an unguided basis with a maximum of 50 in the house at one time to ensure everyone has an enjoyable visit."** Now I could go on and explore his work and influence, as well as his political; writings and much more but I won't, instead recommend you visit the place which Ann has pointed out is "usually open Wednesday to Sunday 11 to 5" So if you miss tomorrow there are also other opportunities. I will await the stories and pictures.

Kids Art〞 image credit: Contributed photo The Orcas Island Education Foundation is sponsoring a wrapping paper fundraiser that is set to kick-off the week of Sept. 21. The proceeds from the campaign will go to support art classes in the public schools. With so little public funding, schools across the country are now relying more on private funds and patrons of the arts to provide creative outlets for students. One of the committees of OIEF is "A-OK" ("Art for Orcas Kids"). A-OK brings local artists to classrooms in the elementary and the middle school to inspire students and help them bring the visual arts to life through age-appropriate projects. Last year, students K-6 had 16 weeks of art class. "This year we want to ensure that our students have the same experience," say organizers. This fall, OIEF has partnered with Innisbrook, a company that shares the islands community sense of environmental awareness. Up to 50 percent of every wrapping paper sale will go toward supporting art in the schools. All standard gift wrap is printed on premium recycled paper, inks are 100 percent water-soluble, and no cardboard cores are included to minimize waste. "The quality is impressive and there is convenient, online ordering," say organizers. "Off-island families and friends can support your student s fundraising efforts." In addition to incentives and prizes offered by Innisbrook, OIEF will award the top-selling class a pizza party. The top-selling student will receive a $50 gift certificate from Darvill's Bookstore.

Eve Donovan is leaving Salem... again. Actress Kassie DePaiva confirmed on Sunday that she has been let go from Days of Our Lives . DePaiva joined the show last year, resurrecting the character of Eve, who was portrayed by Charlotte Ross from 1987 to 1991. "As the sand runs out of my hourglass over at Days ... I have no regrets," DePaiva wrote on her official website . "I had a truly remarkable experience there.

The General Assembly has agreed to hold all primary elections in North Carolina on March 15. The Senate and House voted separately Thursday for the negotiated agreement, which would ensure North Carolina voters will increase influence in choosing the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees. All primaries usually have been held in May. But it also accelerates the decision-making process for potential candidates for other offices, from governor and U.S. senator to state legislator and county commissioner. The candidate filing period would begin Dec. 1. The bill now goes to Gov. Pat McCrory s desk. McCrory has not expressed publicly his views on the bill. Also expected on the March 15 ballot is a statewide referendum on a $2 billion bond package. That bill is moving toward final legislative approval.
This is my personal favorite apple craft. It s quick, easy & super-fun for your kiddos, plus peeling & shaving broken crayons with a crayon sharpener is a fantastic fine motor skill that will help strengthen those weak finger muscles. The packet includes several size apple patterns with & without the poem. Bonus: When the red & yellow shavings melt together they make orange, so grab that teachable moment to talk about secondary colors. Some of my kiddos actually squeal in delight, when I gently remove the wax paper after I have pressed a warm iron on their creation. They definitely have the "Wow!" factor, and make an awesome bulletin board or fall hallway display.

IMAX Corporation has confirmed its new laser projection system will launch in Europe at the UK's Empire Leicester Square on Oct 2 with Robert Zemeckis' The Walk: An IMAX 3D Experience. The dual 4K laser projection system is equipped with a new optical engine and suite of proprietary IMAX technologies capable of projecting an image with maximum resolution and sharpness; 2D and 3D brightness; and an expanded color gamut. The new system also includes IMAX's next-generation sound technology, designed to increase audio immersion. It has been upgraded to 12 discrete channels plus sub-bass, and includes additional side channels as well as new overhead channels that will improve the system's ability to position sounds around the audience. London's Empire Leicester Square opened its IMAX screen in June 2014 and hosts a projected screen image spanning 87-foot (26.5m) wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling - one of the biggest in the UK. Andrew Cripps, president of IMAX EMEA, said titles to be screened at the cinema after The Walk will include Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak, James Bond feature SPECTRE and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
The focus on tackling the housing shortage could be moved away from first time-buyers to older people who have paid off their mortgages, an official has suggested. There is a "real issue" with so-called last-time buyers, a mortgage sector manager at the Financial Conduct Authority reportedly told a conference. Lynda Blackwell called for a debate on the issue, the Daily Mail reported, suggesting building more housing for retired people could encourage older people to move out of their big homes after paying off their mortgages. She said: " Does there need to be thought given to trying to encourage older persons to actually move away - build proper housing for retired people in the right places? "There is a debate to be had about whether the Government s focus is actually in the right place." The average price of a UK property is more than 204,000, according to a report out last week. Share article Halifax said a record low number of homes for sale had helped push the average up. The bank said a shortage of second-hand properties on the market combined with the economic recovery and low mortgage rates are behind the demand.
As more teams are adopting Scrum around Dallas, I've been hearing more questions about how to handle work that is not specifically requested by the Product Owner. How do you handle production support issues in Scrum? How about technical debt? How do you plan time for research? How do you manage defects? According to the Scrum Guide, "the Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases," but what does that look like in execution? Our September Dallas meeting was an open discussion for folks to bring their questions and share experiences about how to deal with all of the work that doesn't fit so neatly in a Product Backlog. We ended up with NINE topics: Dependencies on infrastructure teams Dependencies on waterfall teams Dependencies on external vendors Hybrid work 〞 agile + waterfall Unable to finish stories because of multiple opinions/committee Date-driven + fixed scope + fixed budget challenges Production support Multiple projects/changing velocity from one project to the next Supporting multiple apps/products Since there were so many topics, we held two rounds of small group discussions and reported out learning after each round. It was a productive and engaging meetup, and the comments afterward were great: I had a great time and learned some valuable insights from fellow scrummers. Best experience [at the meetup]. Gained lot of insight. Great breakout sessions and helpful recommendations. Allison, thank you for facilitating. Thank you to everyone who attended and made it a rich evening of learning!

Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting wouldn t "have her career" without horseriding. The Wedding Ringer beauty insists her six horses are the "biggest blessing" in her life and credits the sport for making her "centred" as a person. She said: "I have six horses, and they have been the biggest blessing in my life. "Horseback riding is why I m so centred, especially in this business. I wouldn t have my career without it." To stay healthy, the 29-year-old actress - who is married to Ryan Sweeting - recently adopted a vegan and gluten-free diet and insists it has "completely changed" her. She added: "I m not a vegan, nor do I have a gluten allergy, but it just feels better in my stomach. Everything, from the inside out, has completely changed for me. "And now, when I look into the mirror and see the positive changes, I don t want to go back to what I was doing. Especially when my husband is like, You look amazing! " And Kaley has ditched a bad sweet habit she picked up over the years - of keeping treats in her beside drawer. She told SHAPE magazine: "The drawers next to the bed were filled with candy. Eventually, I realized it was mindless eating. I was just doing it because he was doing it, and it was adding hundreds of calories I didn t even think about."

Most of the parents tend to be inclined to get their child admitted to the top school of the area. Not realizing that the top school may or may not be the best place for your child to be at. Every child has a different mind, different outlook, different grasping power, concentration levels and different interests. Parents must understand that a child's school must be easy on him. What is easy for the other kid may not be a comfortable place for your kid. Hence it is always suggestible to look for the school where your child loves to get up and go every day. At Harvest International School children are put through so many different extra-curricular activities in order to have their interests identified. Then a special emphasize is laid by the teachers individually to foster child's all-round growth along with the academics. Know more at http://harvestinternationalschool.in

The chairman and CEO of United Airlines is stepping down in connection with an investigation into dealings with the agency that operates New York-area airports. United Continental Holdings Inc. said Tuesday that Jeff Smisek and two other senior executives had resigned and railroad executive Oscar Munoz was named CEO and president. United disclosed earlier this year that the company and some of its executives had received subpoenas from a federal grand jury for information about dealings with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Today on Context Florida : The moment Jac Wilder VerSteeg long feared has happened: House Speaker John Boehner is throwing in the towel, resigning not just the speakership, but also his seat in the House. What is the moment VerSteeg feared? When he will remember John Boehner as a "moderate." Peter Schorsch says there is a right, smart way to take on Republican Marco Rubio and there is a dumb, ineffective way to challenge him. What we are seeing out of Donald Trump this week 每 attacking the first-term U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House as a "disloyal" and "sweaty" "lightweight" 每 is the latter. Trump's tactics remind Schorsch of the same losing strategy Charlie Crist employed against Rubio during the 2010 Senate race. Fall is Chris Timmons ' favorite time of the year. Yet, the beginning of fall is also the end of summer reading, which he calls reading at its most ambitious. Unfortunately, that ambition turns to a curse as autumn approaches. Despite the summer disappointment of unfinished reading, fall is here and the cool, elegant flow of this time of year makes Timmons "buoyant and expectant." Visit Context Florida to dig in .

For the Super Bowl s 50th anniversary, the NFL has asked a major performer to return to the halftime stage - and no, it s not Britney Spears . According to Entertainment Weekly , Bruno Mars has been offered the opportunity to headline the halftime show again, only two years after performing at Super Bowl XLVIII. Mars performance was the second most-watched halftime show of all time and the singer is currently still riding the wave of success from Mark Ronson s "Uptown Funk," so it makes sense that the NFL would want him to return. And Spears fans, don t give up hope just yet. According to Billboard , Mars was merely asked to "curate" the show, meaning he would likely be joined by several guests. For Mars last Super Bowl performance, he brought out the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but we all know what the world has really been waiting to see is Mars and Spears break it down to "Oops!... I Did It Again." Watch Mars previous Super Bowl performance below. [embedded content] Other Links From TVGuide.com

Police in Arizona have arrested three teenagers for being copycats to the person who has been shooting at vehicles on the highway. On Sunday, MSN shared that these kids were using a slingshot to actually launch rocks at cars and people making them think that they were being shot at by the person who has been causing problems for the last couple of weeks. The teens admitted that on Saturday they did this to several cars along the highway. The police do not think that they were the same ones that were shooting at cars and are actually copycats instead. There could be more copycats involved as well, but these three have been caught now. They are still in jail at this time on charges of criminal damage and conspiracy. One of their victims was able to get their license plate and turn them in to police after they actually attacked seven vehicles and also six pedestrians. There has not been a confirmed shooting since Thursday, but police are still saying that you should not stop being concerned for your safety in the area. It is unknown when or if the shooter will return and everyone needs to stay on high alert at this time just in case. A 19 year old was brought in and detained, but is not the main suspect. Fox News shared that at this time authorities are not sure if it is only one person shooting or more than one. There could be other copycats out there. Hopefully they can find the suspect before anyone is injured.

LONDON, Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ 〞 Traditionally the on-site setup of the security software resulted in the high cost of ownership including hardware, power, space and management.

Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal said during the "happy hour" GOP debate Wednesday that he would be in favor of jailing and prosecuting mayors of sanctuary cities "as accessories" for crimes committed by illegal immigrants. The remark came as the Louisiana governor responded to accusations of being in favor of amnesty. Jindal said such accusations are not true and that he is in favor of securing the border and going after mayors of sanctuary cities. "What I've also said is that we need to put an end to sanctuary cities. It's not enough to defund them. I think we need to criminalize, accuse and jail those mayors as accessories for the crimes committed by people who shouldn't be here."

DURBAN - The findings into allegations of racism by two Durban rugby players are expected on Monday. The KwaZulu-Natal Rugby Union has been probing claims that the pair used racist slurs against opposition players. The union has promised serious consequences if the two are found guilty.There is no place for racism in rugby. That's the KwaZulu-Natal Rugby Union s message to players at club level but some seemed to have missed it. The provincial body has received three complaints, where the k-word was allegedly used during separate matches. All three incidents involve one club - Durban Collegians and two of the complaints are against the same player. The KZN rugby union says racism is not a widespread problem. It believes clubs cannot be blamed for the behaviour of individual players but some say the clubs need to deal swiftly with offensive behaviour. Durban Collegians has not responded to questions. If found guilty, the accused will be able to appeal the Rugby Union s ruling. - eNCA
Beard Liberation Front Press release September 6th contact Keith Flett 07803 167266 Campaigners say Ed Miliband's decision to shave beard could be bad news for Corbyn credit @HaydenDials [polldaddy poll=9062851] The Beard Liberation Front, the informal network of beard wearers, has said that Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for the Labour leadership may have suffered a blow with the news, revealed on World Beard Day 5thSeptember, that former Labour leader Ed Miliband has shaved off his beard. Miliband grew a beard while on holiday in Australia during August causing a minor storm on social media. It was mooted that it might be a sign of sympathy for Corbyn's leadership bid. However BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew who has interviewed Miliband on Test Match Special in the past reported to listeners of the coverage of the second One Day International between England and Australia at Lords on Saturday that Miliband was present in the crowd and had shaved his beard off. This was later confirmed by BLF sources and several pictures of a clean shaven Miliband appeared on twitter BLF Organiser Keith Flett said Jeremy Corbyn appeared unperturbed by the news, celebrating World Beard Day and his 5 times winning of the Parliamentary Beard of the Year Award on twitter. That said Ed Miliband's defection to the ranks of clean shaven revisionism may still be a factor in the last days of the Labour leadership poll.

Complex is back with another collaborative video with the one and only DJ Khaled . This time the super producer lets us have a look at his insane sneaker closet with all kinds of heat that would more or less point to his Jordan Familia connections. With 20+ foot high ceilings and a ladder just to reach some of the heat, Khaled is back to let his larger than life personality shine and talk more sneakers. DJ Khaled showcases even more exclusive nicknames, this time for his sneaker walls including "Don't Ever Play Yourself" and "War Ready". The problem with having so much heat is trying to keep track of it though, as Khaled talks about an ongoing "street investigation" to find 5 missing pairs. Self-described bangers, here's to hoping Khaled gets his hard-earned sneakers back and that it isn't any of his friends. Check out the full video below, you don't want to miss it.

The Real Pilates studio has been a Tribeca staple for over twenty years now, and after high demand, founder and instructor Alycea Ungaro is expanding her business...twelve blocks north. This November, 333 Hudson Street will house the newest Real Pilates outpost, bringing pilates workshops and personal training to Soho. Real Pilates Tribeca broke ground long before the boutique-fitness boom of the 2000s, and is continuing to thrive despite findings from New York magazine that Pilates has been losing the boutique-fitness race against other classes like barre and yoga for some time now, with popularity decreasing by two percent every year. But if Pilates really is going out of style, patrons of Real Pilates haven t noticed: This move is largely in part to cater to the ever-growing needs of customers. "There has been a huge demand for Real Pilates since we opened the doors to our Tribeca studio over twenty years ago," Ungaro explained in a statement. "Our clients look to us for resistance training in a low-impact yet extremely effective life-long workout. Our Soho location will allow more options for our Tribeca clients while catering to our new Soho neighbors." This new studio comes with 2,200 square feet up on the fourth floor of the building, to allow for additional privacy. Prices remain the same, with group classes going for $32 and private sessions beginning at $95. Real Pilates Soho 333 Hudson St, New York, NY 10013
Global stocks are mixed today as reports from China set a negative early tone off of disappointing economic reads. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.7% and the Nikkei lost 1.6% . Hong Kong s Hang Seng was down 0.3% , while the broad market in Australia ended with a mild gain. There s growing concern China will miss its economic growth target of 7% for the full year based off of new data. European stock markets are broadly higher in early trading. The focus will shift to the U.S. in the middle of the week when the Federal Reserve meets. A recent survey of economists indicated a majority of economists think the Fed will hold rates steady, although the decision is still considered a "toss-up" by many. Economy Oil prices retreated this morning in Asia after several banks issued a weak outlook for demand. Morgan Stanley warned oil fundamentals appear to be slipping again outside the U.S., while Macquarie pointed to pressure on global automobile sales as a potential drag. Jefferies lowered its 2015 forecast on Brent oil by 9% to $54 per barrel and by 10% for the 2016 forecast of $61/bbl. WTI and Brent crude futures have declined in 9 of the last 11 weeks. Crude futures in New York are flat at the moment. A key report on production from OPEC is due out later in the day. Factory output in China rose 6.1% in August to miss the consensus estimate of analysts calling for a mark of 6.4%.
Kim Kardashian is aware that all eyes are on her -- and not just because she has one of the largest followings on Instagram. The "Keeping Up With The Kardashians" star was scrutinized during her first pregnancy in 2013, and it s happening again while she awaits the birth of her son. Kardashian and her husband Kanye West attended the 2015 Video Music Awards on Aug. 30, and she wore a safari-inspired dress by Balmain. The general reaction? Ugh. The ties across her bodice and emphasis on her rear end generated a lot of buzz on social media. Some said she looked like she was wearing a potato sack or resembled the pudgy caterpillar from the animated film "A Bug s Life." She was also compared to Danny DeVito s Penguin character from "Batman Returns." Is it right to criticize a pregnant woman? Or is she fair game because she thrust herself in the public eye all those years ago? Check out some of Kardashian s most recent pregnancy styles and those from when she was expecting daughter North...is her fashion better or worse?
STARR, SC (FOX Carolina) - A Starr woman was charged with attempted murder after she tried to run over her husband with her vehicle, according to arrest warrants. The incident happened Saturday afternoon at a home on Forrest Lane. A witness told deputies that the victim was sitting in his front yard when Juliene Carver sped toward him in a Jeep Grand Cherokee.

THE Boathouse at the University of Limerick will this Saturday host a fun day in aid of Ronald McDonald House which looks after the families of ill children at Crumlin Hospital. The event will get under way at 2pm and last until 5pm, and will feature a five-kilometre family walk, a teddy bear's hospital, archery, face painting and refreshments. Entry to the event is 5 per person or 10 per family, and all the money raised will go towards the running of the Dublin unit. It is hoped to open a larger Ronald McDonald House at the National Children's Hospital. Local businessman Colm O'Brien, who spent time in the house as his daughter was in Crumlin, is helping organise the event in Limerick, one of nine being held on the same day nationally. He is hoping around 200 people attend the event, saying it is more about raising awareness of the facility than raising money. For more information on the event, contact Colm at 087 2836215 Alternatively, visit rmhc.ie To donate to Ronald McDonald House, you can text the simply word 'Walk' to 50300. Some 4 will be charged to your phone or bill, but at least 3.26 of this will go to funding the charity's work adjacent to Crumlin Hospital Dublin.
My Guest will be Steve Piehl who was given a challenging assignment at Harley-Davidson Inc. when the company was fighting for its survival. In the fall of 1982, he was told to organize a group for Harley bike owners who would support their passion for the brand and, hopefully, bring more riders into the fold. At the time, Piehl thought that someday the Harley Owners Group would have tens of thousands of members nationwide. He never imagined that, today, it would have nearly a million members in dozens of countries. After 35 years of working for the Motor Company Steve finally retired. He loves to ride and was even inducted into the Sturgis Motorcycle Hall of Fame. Learn more about the Man behind the mission on the Inside Scoop by Spitfire!
(CNN) 每 If you are flying in or out of Minneapolis-St. Paul airport in Minnesota, be on the lookout for some high art. A giant landscape portrait inspired by Vincent van Gogh's "Olive Trees" was recently completed on property near the airport. The project, commissioned by the Minneapolis Institute of Art as part of its 100th birthday celebration, was designed by earthworks artist Stan Herd. "The amazing thing about van Gogh's painting is there's not a single straight line in the whole canvas. Everything is organic and curved and flowing and it's like a pulse," Herd said in a project video. Herd started working on the design in the spring by arranging plants, soil and mulch to recreate the van Gogh art, which is part of the MIA permanent collection. Van Gogh painted "Olive Trees" in 1889 while he was in southern France, according to the museum website. The landscape art will be on display through the fall.
Road-widening in the Secunderabad Cantonment area is all set to erase a bit of history. A British-era post office building in Bowenpally will be razed soon as part of the development exercise. The post office, adjacent to the Cantonment playground, has become a major bottleneck while widening the two-lane Bowenpally Medchal road (NH 44) to a sixlane one. As per the SCB records, the sub-post office is located on B-1 Land (placed under management of central government) in the Can tonment jurisdiction. The small post office has been serving over 15,000 customers. Currently, nearly 4,000 mails, parcels and other postal services were being delivered to customers by the post office, which has 18 employees, including a sub-postmaster, four postal assistants and 13 postmen, said sources. "The sub-post office is spread over 840 square yards. Already, we have marked the post office (35 feet) from the main road and soon it will be razed. We have sent letters asking them to vacate the premises as early as possible," an SCB engineering official told TOI. "As per our road-widening proposal, we have decided to widen the Bowenpally road from 30 feet to 60 feet. The SCB CEO has already asked the postal department staff to vacate and handover the building. Once they hand over the structure to us, we will demolish the building," he added.

ZION NATIONAL PARK 〞 A major rock fall closed state Route 9 in Zion National Park early Wednesday morning. The large rocks fell on the highway on a switchback near the Pine Creek Bridge and is blocking both sides of the roadway, according to park officials. The road is closed between Canyon Junction and the east entrance of the park. However, the Scenic Drive and Zion Canyon will remain open and all park facilities including the visitor center, museum, campgrounds, and shuttle buses are open and operating as normal. Crews will have to blast the rock and use machinery to clear it from the road, officials said. Until the road is cleared, emergency response will not be available on the east side of Zion National Park. Park officials said expect state Route 9 to reopen by Wednesday evening, but until then, commuters should seek alternate routes. Alternate east and west routes are available via Highway 59 from Hurricane to Fredonia, Arizona and via Highway 14 from Cedar City to Long Valley Junction on Highway 89. People traveling to the park may also access it by traveling east on state Route 9 from I-15. More information will be posted as it becomes available. Faith Heaton Jolley

A woman feared to have been planning to travel to Syria with her four children has been charged with child abduction, Scotland Yard said. Zahera Tariq, 33, was detained in Turkey on Tuesday after the family went missing from their home in Walthamstow, north-east London, last week. She will appear at Camberwell Green Magistrates Court in London later today. The Metropolitan Police said Tariq had been charged with one count of child abduction following an investigation by the force s counter terrorism command (SO15). She was questioned by police after returning to Britain and held at Luton Airport on Thursday night. The family were believed to have flown from London City Airport to Amsterdam on August 25. All of the children - who are aged between four and 12 - were said to be safe and well when the group was detained by Turkish authorities. A private hearing was held in the Family Division of the High Court yesterday about the long-term futures of the children. Mr Justice Cobb said detail of proceedings could not be reported but he said the youngsters were together and had been taken into foster care for the "time being".

Water firm United Utilities faces a compensation bill of at least 15 million to Lancashire households affected by the outbreak of a parasitic bug in supplies. The company said that cheques for payments ranging from 50 to 60 were starting to be sent out to 300,000 households. Homes and businesses in parts of the county were first warned to boil their water before use on August 6 after traces of the microbial parasite cryptosporidium was found in a water treatment works in Preston. Two-thirds of the affected customers now no longer need to boil water for drinking, brushing teeth and food preparation, with the company expecting the water supply to return to normal for the "vast majority" of remaining customers by the weekend. On a Q&A update on its website, United Utilities confirmed that payments had been set following discussions with the Consumer Council for Water. The firm said: "We are making proactive compensation payments to each household affected by this incident which is intended to recognise the additional electricity you may have used, and provide a goodwill gesture payment for both the inconvenience we ve caused and the water service you should have received from us." Share article It added: "There will be no increase in your water charges as a result of the compensation associated with this incident. The company will bear the cost." Business customers were advised to submit evidence and details in writing of claims for any additional losses suffered.
It s like a sort of budget Mad＃ European dairy farmers have been in open revolt over the amount they are being paid for milk. Many say the money they receive does not cover the cost of production, and they are in some instances pointing the finger at allegedly greedy supermarket chains fighting their own price war with rivals.

Construction at the Air Products facility in Pasadena was halted Wednesday (Sept. 23) after a construction worker was killed on the job. According to a report released by Air Products, the worker was a subcontractor employee of a contractor working at the site. "Our thoughts, prayers and condolences are with the family and friends of the deceased," company officials said in the report. No other information such cause of the accident or the identity of the victim has yet been released and the accident remains under investigation. Air Products officials did not return calls seeking further comment.
HONG KONG (CNNMoney) - A key measure of China s all-important manufacturing sector has nose-dived to its lowest level in 78 months, yet another sign that the country s factories are running out of steam. The "flash" measure of sentiment among manufacturing purchasing managers fell to 47.0 in September, the worst figure in more than six years, and a drop from the index s final reading of 47.3 in August, according to Caixin Insight and Markit Economics. Any number below 50 indicates a deceleration in the manufacturing sector. "The principle reason for the weakening of manufacturing is tied to previous changes in factors related to external demand and prices," said He Fan, Caixin Insight s chief economist. "Patience may be needed for policies designed to promote stabilization to demonstrate their effectiveness." Economic data out of China has been dismal in recent months, pointing to an overall economic slowdown. Yet Beijing still seems largely unruffled, and has maintained its 7 percent annual growth target for this year. President Xi Jinping sought to reassure investors on Tuesday, saying that China s economy is operating "within the proper range" during a rare policy address that is part of his first official U.S. state visit. The benchmark Shanghai Composite dipped 0.8 percent in early trading, while stocks in Shenzhen fell 0.3 percent. Hong Kong s Hang Seng dropped by more than 2 percent. Investors will get more manufacturing data on Oct. 1, when Caixin and the Chinese government will release final PMI readings for the month of September.
It won the 1946 Academy award for best original song. As John Boehner entered the stage yesterday, he was singing Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah. A wonderful day to exit. There was cannibalism at work here, as Mr. Boehner was devoured by the same forces that elevated him. The most wrong of the right wing, the strongest brew of the Tea party, the shut it down Chloe, shut it down voices finally were too much for the man of orange. We have watched from his tearful entrance as Speaker to his not so tearful exit. The party of Mr. Boehner is not governable as it is at war with itself as well as with the Democrats. No matter how many government shutdowns, no matter how many anti-Obamacare votes, no matter how many confrontations with the President, it would never be enough. As wrong and stubborn as Mr. Boehner could be, it could never satisfy the insatiable appetite of his fellow House members for Armageddon. Maybe the best joke President Obama told at the annual political roast related to an incident when Mr. Boehner s own turned their ire on him and not the President. "Orange" the President stated, "really is the new black." Mr. Boehner leaves as the walls were closing in on him. It may well be that the last vestiges of common sense, much like Elvis, will be leaving the building when Mr. Boehner departs. Plenty of sunshine may be coming his way, but for the rest of us, even darker clouds loom on the horizon.

As Republicans consider whether it s worth shutting down the government over Planned Parenthood funding, a new poll shows the majority of Americans think keeping the government running should be the priority. Just over seven in 10 Americans say it s more important for Congress to avoid a shutdown than to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, according to a CNN poll conducted Sept. 4-8. Twenty-two percent said ending Planned Parenthood funding should be the priority. Federal operations will shut down on Oct. 1 if Congress doesn t pass a spending bill. However, some Republicans have threatened to vote against any spending bill that allows funds to flow to the medical provider in the wake of a series of controversial videos related to the issue of fetal tissue research. Fetal tissue research is a standard practice, and Planned Parenthood insists it has not been profiting from transferring the tissue to researchers.

6:30 a.m. CDT NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures were slightly higher in volatile trading at the start of the overnight session following comments by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and news that she was receiving medical attention after the speech in which she struggled to finish her last lines. A spokesman for the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where the speech was held, said later that Yellen was expected to resume her schedule Thursday and attend a planned dinner. Among other comments, Yellen said she expects the Fed to raise interest rates later this year. S&P 500 e-mini futures were down 0.2 percent at the start of the overnight session but later turned slightly higher and were last up 0.4 percent. Investors had been cautious on Thursday ahead of the speech, awaiting clues on the timing for the first rate hike in almost a decade. (Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by David Gregorio)
Robert Lewandowski maintained his excellent scoring form with two goals as Bayern Munich defeated Mainz 3-0 on Saturday to stretch their lead at the top of the Bundesliga to five points and extend their winning start to seven games. The Poland captain headed the champions into a 51st-minute lead after they had struggled against disciplined opponents and in doing so became the fastest foreign player to reach 100 Bundesliga goals in his 168th match. Lewandowski, who scored five times in nine minutes after coming on as a substitute against Wolfsburg last Tuesday, struck again in the 63rd minute, rounding the home goalkeeper Loris Karius for his 10th goal in seven matches, a feat only achieved in the past by Gerd M邦ller in the 1968-69 and 1977-78 seasons. The winger Kingsley Coman added Bayern's third five minutes later. Bayern, who play Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League at the Allianz Stadium on Tuesday, are top of the table on 21 points with Borussia Dortmund, who play Darmstadt on Sunday, in second place on 16.

After the United States shut down its airspace after the September 11th attack, a unique problem emerged: international flights. Sure, some planes took off shortly before it was announced the entire U.S. air grid was on lock down, and they could turn back. But what about those beyond the point of no return, or those just about to land? What if the terror threat was broader than what we knew? Insert our neighbor to the north, Canada, which instituted Operation Yellow Ribbon, a plan to land those international flights safely in North America. Of course, the biggest airports in Canada, outside of military bases, are in major urban centers. Given what we didn t know, it wouldn t have made much sense to send potentially hijacked planes to Toronto, so Canada chose airports that weren t in large urban centers, often facilities that were joint airports and Canadian Air Force installations. During the 2010 Olypmics in Canada, Tom Brokaw produced a pair of videos on Operation Yellow Ribbon: In our darkest hours, Canada has been with us. On September 11th, as the United States shut down its airspace, Canada instituted Operation Yellow Ribbon, landing 239 U.S.-bound flights with 33,000 passengers at 17 different Canadian airports. And then, amid the uncertainty that followed, entire communities housed and fed those thousands of passengers for days afteward. One such facility was in Gander, Newfoundland, which took 38 international jetliners. Government of Canada
Bibby Distribution has added seven vehicles to its milk collection fleet that are designed to reduce fuel consumption by using an improved hydraulic pump drive and a Gardner Denver Optiload engine management system which ensures the engine only runs while pumping. The company reckons that the new vehicles use, on average, 53 per cent less fuel during the process of milk collection on the farm than conventional assets. To develop the vehicles, the team at Bibby worked with tank builders Sayers Road Tankers and Crossland Tankers to customise Scania 32-tonne eight by two rigids. The Euro VI trucks are part of a fleet of 50 vehicles that collect 2.5 million litres of milk daily for First Milk, and Bibby calculates that converting all of them will result in a saving of 1,700 tonnes of CO2 over the next five years. First Milk distribution manager Robin Shipton says: "With new technology comes new opportunities to cut costs and carbon; Bibby Distribution's enthusiasm to deliver that innovation exemplifies our relationship. They are a reliable, trustworthy partner which continues to provide bespoke solutions for us and give us the flexibility we need to successfully process highly variable collections and deliveries, which is absolutely critical to our business."
LABOR leader Bill Shorten is set to hold a minor frontbench reshuffle in preparation for the next election. QUEENSLAND senator Jan McLucas and Oxley MP Bernie Ripoll on Tuesday will advise the Labor caucus they will be stepping aside from the shadow ministry. The pair earlier this year indicated they wouldn t be seeking preselection for the next election due in 2016. On Tuesday, nominations for the two shadow ministry positions will open and they will be resolved at the next meeting of caucus. Senator McLucas was first elected in 1998 and helped establish the national disability insurance scheme. Mr Ripoll, who also came into parliament in 1998, chaired the committee that led the landmark inquiry into the future of finance advice. He also played a key role in dealing with the 2011 Queensland floods.
dia wrestler Bajrang narrowly missed out on a third-place finish, going down in the bronze medal play-off round in men's 61kg Freestyle category even as other Indians continued to disappoint at the World Championship here. Besides Bajrang two other Indian men 〞 Naresh Kumar (86kg) and Mausam Khatri (97kg) 〞 failed to make it to the medal round. While Sarita wrapped off the female wrestling competition on a dismal note, losing in the qualification round itself. Arjuna Awardee Bajrang did not have an ideal start as he was beaten by the eventual silver medallist Batbold Nomin of Mongolia 0-10 in the qualification round. But since his Mongolian rival reached the final, Bajrang made it to repechage round, where he won both his bouts to advance to the bronze medal play-off. In his two repechage bouts, he first defeated local grappler Reece Weslee Humphrey 6-0 before getting the better of Beka Lomtadze of Georgia 13-6. POST YOUR COMMENTS

People created an ideology labeled, "Have at the expense of others." This is the deepest cause of human unhappiness and it is the cause of all our diseases. The moment we think in separative terms, that moment we cut ourselves from the facet of Oneness, we create conflict in our whole system. One day people will realize that cancer is the result of all the accumulated signals impressed upon our genes while we were serving separatism and self-interest in our thoughts, emotions, and actions. Of course, all separatism and self-interest is occupied with jealousy, fear, hatred, and revenge. Such states of consciousness affect our cells, and the cells try to live a separate life. -Torkom Saraydarian Cosmic Questions vol.3
Labor has accused the Liberals of failing to match its $170 million commitment for roads in the Canning electorate. Labor candidate for the by-election Matt Keogh has pledged to duplicate Armadale Road, construct North Lake Bridge, and upgrade Denny Avenue and fix its intersections in Kelmscott. After Liberal candidate Andrew Hastie said he d met with the WA transport minister to discuss road projects in Canning, including extending Tonkin Highway south and fixing congestion on Armadale Road, Mr Keogh said the Liberals had "refused to match Labor s commitment". But Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: "We re not so desperate to win that we turn up and throw $170 million at something without talking to the state government about its priorities".

September 17. September 24. September 28. What do these three days have in common? Crippling Facebook outages, of course! Facebook has gone down for the third time in recent weeks , and this was the worst outage of the bunch in terms of how long Facebook was down and how wide the outage was. From what I saw on Twitter, a whole lot of people were put out by this, and that's bad news for the ubiquitous service. For a service that prides itself on always being available, that's a lot of outages, and it makes you wonder what's going on behind the scenes at Facebook to cause these issues. Are they tinkering with something new? Are they just getting unlucky? Is this the sign of some bigger flaw? No one's talking; Facebook instead is blaming it on configuration issues and promises to get things up and running post-haste. Said a Facebook spokesperson: "We're currently restoring Facebook services that people had trouble accessing earlier today due to a configuration issue. We're working to bring things back to normal for everyone. We apologize to those who have been inconvenienced."

Amid 18 months of uncertainty over whether Gerry Adams would face charges, a prosecution against another veteran republican has been proceeding through the courts. Ivor Bell was charged last year with involvement in the murder of Jean McConville. After a number of court extensions to consider the evidence, Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service (PPS) confirmed in the summer it intended to pursue the charges. The announcement in June ended mounting doubts over the future of the case. Bell, 78, from Ramoan Gardens in west Belfast, was arrested and charged in March last year. He is accused of aiding and abetting the murder of the widow, who was abducted from her home in west Belfast in 1972. Bell faces a further count of IRA membership. He denies the charges. A decision has yet to be taken in a magistrates' court on whether the evidence against Bell is strong enough to send him for trial at Crown Court. Part of the PPS case against Bell is based on a tape police secured from an oral history archive collated by Boston College in the US. Detectives claim one of the interviews given by a man codenamed "Z" was Bell - an allegation the defendant denies. During a hearing in June, Bell's solicitor insisted the PPS case was "not complex'. "It is a one-issue case,' he added. "It's the issue of, is the person on the tape Ivor Bell? And that cannot be proven."

Goals from George Brady and Duncan Watmore sealed the win to end the Saints' unbeaten start to the season. Sunderland were ahead on 12 minutes when a left-wing corner was headed home by Brady. And it was 2-0 just before half-time when Watmore coolly netted from the spot after being fouled in the penalty area. Southampton were harshly awarded a penalty on 53 minutes but Ryan Seager's effort was saved by Maksimilian Stryjek, diving to this right. Saints pressed to get back into the game but were well kept in check by the young Cats.
Iraq says it has reached a deal to share intelligence with Russia and Iran as part of an effort to defeat the Islamic State group, which controls large parts of the region. French warplanes also carried out their first airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, hitting targets identified during reconnaissance missions over the past two weeks, according to the BBC. A statement from Iraq s joint operations command on Saturday said the intelligence sharing had come as a result of "increased Russian concern about the presence of thousands of terrorists from Russia undertaking criminal acts with Daesh (Islamic State)." It follows last week s Russia s forward deployment of warplanes at Latakia , in western Syria. Reuters writes: "The move could give Moscow more sway in the Middle East. It has stepped up its military involvement in Syria in recent weeks while pressing for Damascus to be included in international efforts to fight Islamic State, a demand Washington rejects." Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande said with his nation s first airstrikes it "struck in Syria this morning an Islamic State training camp which threatened the security of our country." "What we want is to know what is being prepared against us and what is being done against the Syrian population," Hollande said.

Baku, September 18, AZERTAC Five opposition parties submitted a no-confidence motion against the Cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday over controversial security bills, according to Kyodo. The parties filed the motion at the House of Representatives as part of their tactics to delay the enactment of the bills, which could enable Japanese troops to fight overseas for the first time since World War II. The motion is likely to be voted down at the chamber, where Abe s ruling coalition holds a majority. The lower house has already passed the bills, which could be put to a vote at the House of Councillors as early as Friday despite strong public criticism that the legislation would undermine Japan s pacifist Constitution.

Josh Cook was full of praise for his Power Maxed Racing team as he claimed a first ever British Touring Car podium in the second race of the day at Rockingham. Storming from P14 on the grid, the Chevrolet Cruze driver produced a series of stunning overtakes before relegating Adam Morgan to fourth on the final lap. In what has been a character building but strong rookie year in the series, Cook was delighted to have claimed a maiden rostrum and in-doing so, took another step closer to the Jack Sears Trophy. "It was a tough race but brilliant," admitted Cook to BTCC Crazy. "It was a legitimate podium as well because we didn't luck in due to the reverse grid, it was very much earned as we started from row eight. It was a great move to stick on Adam Morgan and because he is a ginger bloke as well, I liked to think that he was thinking like I was. "The Power Maxed team have done brilliantly though this season to produce a car as good as this. We've had a few issues here and there but everyone has kept their heads down to ensure we are able to continue to push forward and be in the mix. "As we know anything can happen in this championship but I'm hopeful there will be more to come later this season." PHOTO CREDIT: Matt Sayle Photography

As we never tire of pointing out, perhaps the most amusing thing about Russia's stepped up role in Syria is the extent to which it represents the calling of Washington's ISIS bluff. For more than a year now, the US and its regional allies have purportedly been engaged in a sweeping effort to defeat Bakr al-Baghdadi's army and rid the world of what's been billed as the greatest threat to humanity since the Third Reich. Curiously, ISIS is still operating and still making periodic territorial gains despite the fact that when you strip away all of the nuance what you have is a ragtag militia battling the most advanced air force on the planet. There are of course no shortage of conspiracy theories as to what exactly is going on and even if one wishes to avoid going so far as to...

Washington D.C., September 23 (QNA) - U.S. President Barack Obama has in a phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged European countries to host their "fair share" of refugees in order to address the Syrian refugee crisis. "The two leaders agreed on the need for a Europe-wide solution in which all European member states accept their fair share of refugees," the White House said in a statement. "They also discussed how to alleviate the root causes of the refugee flow, in particular by facilitating a political transition that can unite Syrians," the statement added. (QNA)
CANNES: The Azteca telenovela Tanto Amor tells the story of Alberto and Mia, whose long and eventful journey leads to romance and happiness in the midst of tragedy and betrayal. An equally strong sense of justice drives these two characters as they fight for a love marked by absence, says Marcel Vinay Jr., the CEO of Comarex, which distributes titles for Azteca. Once I Loved You, another Azteca novela and MIPCOM highlight, is also a story of love and betrayal, where money permeates the lives of all those who live in a prosperous and fertile wine-producing valley. Meanwhile, the telenovela As赤 En El Barrio Como En El Cielo shows what happens when chance leaves the rich impoverished and turns the poor into millionaires. "As赤 En El Barrio Como En El Cielo is a potpourri of passion, love, laughter, hate and retaliation, with the odd miracle thrown in for good measure," Vinay Jr. says.

Rick Perry is dropping out of the race for president, ending his second bid for the Republican nomination and becoming the first major candidate of the 2016 campaign to give up on the White House. Perry s campaign said the longest-serving governor in Texas history would tell a group of conservative activists in St. Louis on Friday night that "some things have become clear." "We have a tremendous field, the best in a generation, so I step aside knowing our party is in good hands, and as long as we listen to the grassroots, the cause of conservatism will be too," Perry planned to say according to remarks released by his campaign . Perry suspended his struggling campaign while strapped for campaign cash and stuck polling at near zero.

"One person -- a real loser said he s a clown. Now they are saying -- how are we going to stop this guy. I haven t heard the word clown in a while," he said. Trump, in characteristic bombastic style, boasted that he was leading all the opinion polls because people had latched on to his vow to make America great again.

We are really killing it," and said voters he has called the "silent majority" borrowing a phrase from President Richard Nixon were finally making their voices heard. "It is not silent.

The Seattle Police Department (SPD), with Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) support, will conduct the second in a series of transit lane emphasis patrols on Thursday, September 17 on Howell Street near 9 th Avenue in Downtown Seattle from about 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Extra officers will be assigned to enforce existing lane restrictions during the afternoon commute. Illegal use of Howell Street transit lanes can delay thousands of bus riders and has been the subject of complaints from transit riders and motorists alike.

Even a small number of transit lane violators can bring buses to a halt. SPD and SDOT have teamed up to reduce transit lane and other violations, such as blocking of intersections, in an effort to keep traffic and transit moving.
Did you ever wonder what Caitlyn and Kris Jenner's first face-to-face meeting would be like? Now we know. Video of the ex-spouses' tense first meeting since Caitlyn's transition was posted on E! Online on Thursday. In the clip, Kris, 59, arrives at her 65-year-old ex's Malibu mansion. "Oh my goodness, look at you! Nice shoes!" Kris says when the door opens. Things don't get any easier from there, with the two nervously measuring the situation before sitting down across from one another so that Caitlyn can say "So?" just as the video comes to an end. While the two had communicated through family members after Caitlyn's transition earlier this year, the meeting was the first time they were in the same room, according to the website. Caitlyn, then known as Bruce, and Kris finalized their divorce last December after 23 years of marriage. The rest of the meeting will presumably be featured on Sunday night's episode of Caitlyn's E! series "I Am Cait."

SAFETY: Cycling 101 Needn't Be Collision Course. "Cycling as recreation, sport and transport has exploded in recent years, with continued growth likely as more locales install bike lanes and bike-share programs. But as you might expect, with that growth has come an increase in bike-related injuries." Yesterday, I passed a cyclist going the wrong way in the left lane on Kingston Pike, one of Knoxville's busiest multilane thoroughfares. You never used to see that, but lately it's become common. There seem to be a lot more idiots out there on bicycles.

Posted on September 10th, 2015 Rec Boat Holdings is debuting two of its boats in Europe this week at the Cannes Yachting Festival 〞 the new Four Winns TS222 and the Four Winns Vista 255. The company announced several new 2016 products on Wednesday at the show, hosted by the management team from Rec Boat Holdings and one of the newest French dealers for the brand, Massif Marine Groupe. The all-new Vista 255, a trailerable pocket cruiser, was the flagship of the show for Four Winns, followed by the new family tow sports model, the TS222. "The TS222 promises to be a solid 'no compromise' competitor in the steadily growing towboat segment," Rec Boat Holdings president Roch Lambert said in a statement . "We can now offer consumers a boat that will deliver all the fun of a traditional towboat while providing a roomier, better-handling boat normally experienced with sterndrive power." The Vista 255 fills a void, Lambert said. "There is a void in the market for this style product, especially in overseas markets," he said in a separate statement . "The design was largely influenced by our dealers in order to hit the market with the right boat. The Vista 255 fills the gap perfectly." The company was bought by Beneteau Group last summer. Lambert told Trade Only last winter that Beneteau was not only looking to expand its presence in the United States with the acquisition, but also to help Rec Boat Holdings brands penetrate the European market.
WASHINGTON -- The biggest series of the year has arrived for the Washington Nationals, and they are ready for the challenge. Washington opens a three-game set against the first-place New York Mets on Monday, and with it comes a golden opportunity to close the gap between them and surprising New York. "It s a good momentum builder going into this series," Nationals starter Joe Ross said after his team completed a four-game sweep of the Braves on Sunday. The Nationals appeared to be in control of the NL East when a midseason swoon combined with a Mets surge gave New York as lead that has been as big as 7 1/2 games. Now, Washington knows it can t afford to squander these head-to-head matchups. "It feels like we ve got a long way to go," Nationals manager Matt Williams said. The Nationals ordered their rotation so their top pitchers will face New York, with Max Scherzer starting Monday and Jordan Zimmermann pitching Tuesday. Washington has Wednesday s starter as TBA, but the thought is if Stephen Strasburg is fully recovered from back issues, he will get the nod. "We have a great staff and when you have three of your horses going against a great Mets team, I like our chances," outfielder Bryce Harper said. "They re very good and we re very good also." Washington enters the series 6-7 against the Mets this season.

A lawyer for a New York City high school teacher charged with reckless endangerment for crashing his drone at the U.S. Open tennis tournament says his client was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Andrew Marshall said Thursday that client Daniel Verley is an educator and amateur photographer who just wanted to shoot images of the globe sculpture at Flushing Meadows Park as the sun set. He says the drone went haywire, and the crash was an accident. The drone buzzed diagonally over the court in Louis Armstrong Stadium before plummeting into the seats during the next-to-last game of a second-round match. No one was injured. The 26-year-old Verley was arraigned Wednesday.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. - More than one third of students failed to meet MAP testing standards. States, like Missouri, need to set tough standards and take an "honest" look at how kids are really doing, said Federal Education Secretary, Arne Duncan. The numbers of students having to take remedial, no-credit, classes in college are "staggering," said Duncan. "It d be good for your listeners to know, what are the remediation rates in Missouri and is that acceptable or not?" said Duncan. "I think folks would be pretty stunned at how high they are, the state needs to think about a set of standards that will ensure that young people can no just go to college but be successful there." Missouri needs to set higher standards in the future and challenge students to meet those goals, Duncan said. "A high school diploma is simply not enough to get a good paying job these days," said Duncan. "Whether it is a four year university, a two year community college; trade, technical ,vocational training- that needs to be the goal for every single young person in the state of Missouri and across the country." States can develop their own test, which is what education officials are doing now. They hope to have it ready in time for kids to test next spring.
Web companies that rely on Amazon s cloud computing service experienced downtime over the weekend when a problem with the AWS DynamoDB database resulted in outages. Affected services included Tinder, IMDb and Amazon s own Instant Video and Books sites. Netflix, a well-known AWS user, experienced only a minimal disruption because the company had failover precautions in place that allowed it to switch quickly from the affected AWS region to a fully operational region. Rob Enderle, principal analyst with Enderle Group, said this should be "a cautionary tale for any AWS customer." He added, "In the end, Amazon does not have adequate failover protection, which means its customers need to make sure they do." View article

As I said in my five things post last week, we spent alot of time eating while we were on the cruise. Andrews favourite pre-dinner snack was a hot dog from the hot dog stand so we spent alot of time our time out on the boardwalk. It was just on the floor below our room so it was super easy to pop down and although I could never handle a hotdog before a (usually) four course meal, I did have a couple through the holiday! There was loads of choice with seven different sausages to choose from - I usually went for a coney island dog with onions mmm. Here I am wearing my pretty new playsuit from Lilylulu. I loved how floaty it is, making it perfect for holidays and the cute cut out shoulders were something different too which was nice. It was a little bit see through but I just fixed that with white underwear. Another issue here is that my legs are a little bit more hairy that I would like oops. I just forget about shaving my legs - super bad I know and its super strange because I spend most of my time at work writing articles with titles like "How to keep your legs smooth all summer". I think laser hair removal is the way forward for me - then I wont ever have to think about shaving ever again!!

Sky Commanders joined the Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera in 1987, and in a surprise, launched in July of that year. Unfortunately, it lasted just 1 season. Mike Summitt (Robert Ridgely, ex-Flash Gordon, Thundarr, Tarzan) leads the Commanders against the evil General Plague. Why the networks passed on this show, I don t know. Following is the intro. Danny Dark (ex-Super Friends), by this point a studio announcer for NBC, narrates. Dark, unfortunately, was not credited, which is a shame, as this was his last job for Hanna-Barbera after being with the studio for nearly 15 years. No rating. Didn t see the show.
Artist s impression of the lobby. Credit: Milial Resort Hotels MILIAL Resort Hotels has revealed that a new property 每 the Tokyo Disney Celebration Hotel 每 is slated for a June 2016 opening in the Shin-Urayasu area near Tokyo Disney Resort. The 702-room hotel marks the fourth Disney hotel to operate in Japan alongside the Disney Ambassador Hotel, Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta and Tokyo Disneyland Hotel. According to a statement, the decision was made to develop a new hotel as the existing Disney properties have a high annual occupancy rate of over 90 per cent. The three billion yen (US$25.1 million) Tokyo Disney Celebration Hotel will be redeveloped from the existing Palm and Fountain Terrace Hotel by Brighton Corporation. In preparation for the new hotel, the two buildings of the Palm & Fountain Terrace Hotel will close separately; the Fountain Terrace Hotel will close on February 27, 2016 while the Palm Terrace Hotel will close on June 1, 2
Schoolgirl Alice Gross s suspected killer, who was found hanged just days after her body was pulled from a river, "took his own life", a coroner has ruled. The body of Arnis Zalkalns was discovered in Boston Manor Park, west London, in October last year, four days after 14-year-old Alice was found weighted down in the Grand Union Canal in Ealing. Scotland Yard later said the 41-year-old Latvian - who had previously served seven years for murdering his wife in his home country - would have been charged with Alice s murder if he had still been alive. At an inquest into Zalkalns death at West London Coroner s Court, coroner Chinyere Inyama said: "There is no other reasonable alternative explanation. I record that Arnis Zalkalns took his own life."

Translated by Google Translator: Translated by Google Translator: SINGAPORE (Sept 25): Singapore s August industrial production data due later today will likely hint at a risk of a technical recession, says DBS. A technical recession occurs when there are two consecutive quarters of decline in gross domestic product. DBS predicts a 6.8% on-year decline in industrial output in August. The median estimate in a poll of seven analysts -- including DBS -- by The Wall Street Journal predicts a 5.1% decline. DBS says the 8.4% on-year decline in the main non-oil domestic exports in August is another indicator of a slowing Singapore economy. "External headwinds arising from the deceleration in China s growth was the key reason behind the dire [exports] outcome. PMIs of all key markets have also turned southwards while the knock-on effects from the equity market debacle in China and the impact of the yuan devaluation have yet to be fully manifested," says DBS. The August industrial production data will be released at 1pm today.
Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is dropping out of the race for president, ending his second bid for the Republican nomination and becoming the first major candidate of the 2016 campaign to give up on the White House. Perry s campaign said the longest-serving governor in Texas history would tell a group of conservative activists in St. Louis on Friday night that "some things have become clear." "We have a tremendous field, the best in a generation, so I step aside knowing our party is in good hands, and as long as we listen to the grassroots, the cause of conservativism will be too," Perry planned to say according to remarks released by his campaign. Perry suspended his struggling campaign while strapped for campaign cash and stuck polling at near zero.

A man who family members said threatened to harm himself was killed by police late Tuesday night after a confrontation in front of his South Miami-Dade home. According to Miami-Dade police, after they followed 41-year-old Jorge Suarez-Ruiz home, he got out of his car and some type of confrontation took place leading two officers to fire their weapons. Police said a firearm was recovered and Suarez-Ruiz died at the scene. "The subject exited his vehicle and immediately there was a confrontation," Miami-Dade police Detective Jennifer Capote said in a statement. "Shots were fired and the subject was pronounced dead on the scene." Neither of the officers 〞 not named but one a four-year veteran, the other 14 〞 were injured. Police said they initially received a call about Suarez-Ruiz at 9:40 p.m. But when they got to the home at 16020 SW 42nd Ter., Suarez had already taken off in a Toyota Camry. Police found him nearby. They said family members said he had been threatening to hurt himself and that he often carried a firearm. When police tried to stop Suarez-Ruiz, he refused and continued driving, leading them back to the home where the shooting took place. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the shooting.

Richardson said he would release "as much as they can. " Richardson was Secretary of Energy in former President Bill Clinton s second cabinet. "I would just release as much as they can," Richardson advised. "They re doing that. I think the concentration should be on issues.

Kentucky clerk Kim Davis has landed her first official interviews after the brief jail stint that launched her to celebrity status. Davis will be sitting down with both ABC News Paula Faris on Good Morning America on Sept. 22 and Fox News Megyn Kelly on The Kelly File on Sept. 23 per The Hollywood Reporter . Expect questions about religious freedom, the separation of church and state, Davis conscience and whether or not she disobeyed a judge s order about altering marriage licenses for same-sex couples. Though Davis was very public and celebratory when released from jail on Sept. 8, she has not yet spoken with a national news program about her actions. County Clerk Kim Davis reports for work - but will she issue marriage licenses? Davis found herself in the spotlight earlier this month, after refusing to issue marriage licenses to couples since the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage. After being held in contempt of court for refusing to follow the law, she spent five days in jail. She then became a hot topic for Republican presidential hopefuls, namely her staunch supporter Mike Huckabee, and was even the subject of a question in CNN s recent GOP debate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor markets were tight enough to fuel small wage gains in some professions in recent weeks, though some companies already were feeling a chill from an economic slowdown in China, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. ＃ WASHINGTON U.S. labor markets were tight enough to fuel small wage gains in some professions in recent weeks, though some companies already were feeling a chill from an economic slowdown in China, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. Overall, U.S. economic activity continued to expand across most regions and sectors from July to mid-August, the Fed said in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide. The combination of a healing labor market and worries about Chinese economic growth underscored the challenge faced by the U.S. central bank as it mulls raising interest rates as soon as this month. While many Fed policymakers think the U.S. labor market is close to full strength, China is casting a long shadow on the global economy. Prospects of slower global growth are weighing on oil prices, making it likely the Fed will undershoot its 2 percent inflation target for some time. Some companies contacted by the Boston Fed, which compiled data from other regional Fed banks, said China was weighing on their performance. "Many of our contacts mentioned China as a performance factor, but so far the effects are modest," the Boston Fed said in the report, pointing to weaker Chinese demand for manufacturing and information technology products and services.

Edison, N.J. -- Aerosoles has appointed a retail and footwear veteran with more than two decades of experience as CEO. The company named retail and footwear industry veteran executive R. Shawn Neville as CEO, effective Sept. 8. He takes over from interim CEO Caryn Lerner, operating partner of Palladin Consumer Retail Partners, which acquired privately owned Aerosoles in June 2014. Neville comes to Aerosoles following six years at Avery Dennison Corp., leading its $1.6 billion retail branding and information solutions division as president. Previously, he spent four years as a senior officer of Stride Rite and president of its Keds division, after five years with Footstar, as president and CEO of its athletic division, and he also served in the same role with Footaction USA. He also served as CEO and president of team sports apparel company, Boathouse Sports. In the 1990s Neville spent seven years with Reebok International, finishing his tenure as senior VP and general manager of Reebok North America and president of Reebok France. Neville's initial key initiatives in his new role will include strengthening Aerosoles go-to-market strategy, branding, store design, merchandising, product development, e/m-commerce and overall expansion strategy. "I am very excited to be joining a company and brand with such a strong heritage, innovative proprietary technologies, and commitment to delivering fun stylish products to its consumers," stated Neville. "The brand has tremendous potential to become a powerful lifestyle brand rooted in helping women look and feel great." Aerosoles operates 120 U.S. retail and outlet stores, and is also sold at major department and specialty stores.

Barack Obama will test his survival skills in an episode of Running Wild With Bear Grylls, US TV channel NBC has announced. The American President will take to the brutal wilderness of Alaska with British survival expert Bear to highlight the effects of climate change in the area. The episode will be recorded during Obama's three-day trip to the US State and will air on NBC later this year. As soon as the appearance was announced, a petition was launched calling on the President to drink his own urine for "science reasons." And no it shouldn t come to this! (I hope!) https://t.co/0RHdDZjg1i 〞 Bear Grylls (@BearGrylls) August 31, 2015 The petition reads: "If there s one thing we all know about Bear Grylls techniques, it s that they mostly involve drinking his own urine. And so: We ask that Obama do the right thing and drink his own urine during a taping of "Running Wild with Bear Grylls." For science. The people demand it." In less than 24 hours, the petition has already amassed over 100,000 signatures. Barack is the latest celebrity to appear on the survival show following in the footsteps of Kate Winslet , Kate Hudson, Zac Efron and Channing Tatum. Last month Fast & Furious star Michelle Rodriguez hit the headlines when she ate a mouse stewed in her own urine on the show. Urgh!

By HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares in Asian-listed commodity firms fell on Tuesday, after a plunge in trader Glencore PLC 0805.HK stock a day earlier unnerved resource sector investors already worried about weak demand from China. Glencore s London-listed shares tumbled 30 percent on Monday after analysts at investment bank Investec raised doubts about its valuation if spot metal prices do not improve. The note also pointed to high debt levels and a need for deeper restructuring. In Singapore, shares in commodity trader Noble Group fell as much as 15 percent to their lowest since late 2008. Miner BHP Billiton dropped 6 percent to its lowest since December 2008, and smaller rival Rio Tinto Ltd lost 4.5 percent to its lowest since May 2009. "There is a crisis of confidence and people are continuing to de-leverage commodity stocks exposure," said Benjamin Chang, CEO of hedge fund LBN Advisers, which manages about $600 million in funds. "People are ignoring valuations as the near-term outlook continues to be bearish," he added. London copper held steady on Tuesday but was near last month s six-year trough as concerns about weak demand from China hammered mining equities and eroded support for metals.

THE Calais migrant crisis and the Tunisia terror attack are deterring Britons from taking holidays abroad, new research shows. Three-quarters of tourists said they are now actively avoiding Islamic countries for their breaks because of terrorism. The same number said the chaos in Calais had put them off travelling through the Chunnel or on Eurostar. More than half admitted that the Tunisia beach massacre earlier this year had stopped them planning or booking a holiday anywhere abroad. Fear of being caught up in an Islamist atrocity or in mayhem caused by the migration situation gripping the EU means holidaymakers are preferring to go as far away as Australia and the Caribbean for their touch of winter sun. Tourism specialist Yeganeh Morakabati, who carried out the research at Bournemouth University, said: "Usually when Britain has a cool and wet summer, we are keen to take a holiday somewhere warm. The events of this summer, however, have impacted the choices of British holidaymakers." Countries traditionally used for a winter getaway, such as Greece, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Turkey, are all falling in popularity . Italy, Spain, France, Portugal and the US are the five most popular choices for general holidays in the coming year, the study showed. Fewer than one per cent of Britons said they would think of going to Tunisia even if the Foreign Office lifted its travel ban on the country.
Housing investment has been considered as a major contributor to economic growth with many social and economic benefits. This research work was carried out to evaluate the impact of Government Assisted Housing Programmes (GAHPs) in Bauchi State. The methodology employed were Oral interview, Self-assessment, Checklist and Questionnaires. Two target groups were considered for this research: the first group was construction professionals such as Architects, Engineers, Quantity surveyors, Builders and Service Engineers involved in the construction of such housing programmes, while the second group was family heads/occupants of government housing programmes. The research was conducted using completed Tambari housing estate and 1000-units of two bedrooms semi-detached / three bedrooms under construction at Dungal as case studies. The information obtained from these case studies were analysed using relative index, linear correlation, regression and one - way ANOVA (Analysis of variance). The research revealed that the first five critical impact of housing programmes were employment for skilled and unskilled workers (RI = 0.77); increase demand for building materials market (RI =0. 75); Generates income and employment in a number of related /non-related industry (RI = 0.75); increases income to land owners due to compensation paid for land acquisition (RI=0.74) and attracts infrastructural facilities to such localities (RI = 0.72). It also revealed that most of the respondents were satisfied with the impact of GAHPs within their vicinity.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said on Sunday that Germany had temporarily introduced controls along its border with Austria in an attempt to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving in the country. "At this moment Germany is temporarily introducing border controls again along (the EU s) internal borders. The focus will be on the border to Austria at first," he said. "The aim of these measures is to limit the current inflows to Germany and to return to orderly procedures when people enter the country," he said, adding that this was also necessary for security reasons.

Comments (0) Officers are appealing for witnesses after a teenage girl was slapped and spat at as she walked home in Ramsgate. The victim, a 15-year-old from Ramsgate, was walking along King Street towards the town centre at about 11.30pm with her friend on Saturday September 5 when she says she saw a group of people. She says she walked past and could hear them shouting at her when some of them ran in front of them, blocking their path. They carried on walking but as they got further up the road the group returned and cornered them. The victim then says one of the girls in the group slapped her round the face and others spat at her. She managed to escape but her attacker saw her on Harbour Street when she says the girls appeared again and pushed her up against a wall and started slapping her and pulling her hair. She then says that one of the girls pulled her hair and punched and kneed her in the face before an unknown person pulled her away from the group. She was taken to hospital and treated for bruising and bumps to her head and face. Investigating officer PC Megan Palmer said: "This was a terrible attack on a young girl but thankfully a stranger stopped it from going any further. As it was a busy Saturday night there would have been lots of people around. We need to speak to anyone who may have been in the area at the time." Anyone who may have seen the incident is asked to contact PC Megan Palmer on 01843 222289 quoting reference ZY/0280

13:06 Tuesday 15 September 2015 0 Have your say Hasland CFC Ladies opened their Division One season with a dominant 5-2 win over newly promoted Pride Park Ladies. Goals from Leann Cole (2), Emily Mapley-Sims (2) and Cath Costello gave the Hasland side the win in a game which saw four players make their full debut. It took nine minutes for Hasland to make the breakthrough when Mapley-Sims cut back the ball from the byline for last season's top scorer Cole to stroke home from close range. Cole got a second three minutes later when she latched on to a lobbed ball over the top of the Pride Park defence and buried into the keeper's bottom left corner. Hasland were comfortable and Mapley-Sims extended the lead after debutant Tania Shelley played an accurate cross field ball to start off a lovely passing move. Pride Park pulled a goal back before Mapley-Sims hit the post from close range. Another debutant Cath Costello made it 4-1 after player of the match Kirbi Jackson found her in the area. The game was well and truly put to bed in the 73rd minute when Mapley-Sims used her raw pace to break into the box and fire high into the corner to make it 5-1. Pride Park scored from a rare breakaway to add a little bit respectability to the scoreline as it finished 5-2.
Well it seems as though Hawthorn are on their way to Perth to face the Dockers for a spot in the big dance, however there was plenty of controversy surrounding this score review on Friday night. Luke Breust looked to have his fourth goal in the bag, as the football slid off the side of the Hawthorn forward s boot and through the big sticks. However, the contact looked to be questionable and the goal was sent upstairs for review. The on-field call was goal, and it seemed as though there was no conclusive evidence to overturn the decision, as per the rules. Well, you wouldn't believe it, but the decision was indeed overturned. Go figure＃ This was a tight call! It was judged a rushed behind by the man upstairs. http://t.co/35dNSP2dnT 〞 AFLFinals (@AFL) September 18, 2
The Seahawks spent the week aggressively scanning the trade market for safety depth behind current no-show Kam Chancellor, . It didn t take them long to zero in on a target. The Seahawks have traded for Chiefs safety Kelcie McCray, Kansas City announced on Saturday. It cost them a fifth-round draft pick, NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported, according to a source informed of the deal. The 6-foot-1, 26-year-old undrafted free agent out of Arkansas State spent time with the Miami Dolphins and Bucs before a year-long stint with the Chiefs. It s the second time in a little more than a year that McCray has been traded McCray has appeared in 31 career games, logging 17 tackles and a pass breakup. The move will give Seattle some peace of mind as they try and sort out a hectic contract impasse with Chancellor. His holdout will soon enter its sixth week.

:39 Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez look set to start an Argentina match together for the first time since the 2010 World Cup in Tuesday s friendly against Mexico in Dallas. Coach Gerardo Martino said on Monday he would change most of the side who beat Bolivia 7-0 in Houston on Friday and has been practicing with the pair and new talent Angel Correa in attack. "The team will be made up mostly of those who didn t play the other day," Martino told a news conference in Dallas. Atletico Madrid s Correa, who made his debut against Bolivia, Messi and Tevez were all substitutes on Friday. "We know the crowds are keen to see Lionel (play) and we don t turn a blind eye to that but we also have to look after the players bodies," added Martino. Diego Maradona was the last Argentina coach to pair Messi and Tevez in attack in the 2010 quarter-final in Cape Town in which Germany crushed his team 4-0. Alejandro Sabella, who steered Argentina to the 2014 final, a 1-0 defeat by Germany in Rio de Janeiro, did not pick Tevez at all during his four years in charge. Martino recalled the striker last November and he has since made eight appearances, seven as a substitute, boosting his caps total to 72. Messi, who came on in the 65th minute on Friday, scored twice to take his Argentina tally to 48, six short of Gabriel Batistuta s record of 54. Sergio Aguero also scored twice and laid on three other goals as he took his tally level with Maradona at 32.

Nastco/ThinkStock We've been asking for it for years, and now we're finally getting it. At a town hall meeting Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook will soon have a "dislike" button. Business Insider reports that Zuckerberg didn't initially want it as a part of Facebook social media experience because he feared it would lead to a Reddit-like "up vote/down vote" type of situation. But, the social media kingpin has changed his mind, realizing that people want it not to vote, but to show empathy. Zuckerberg said , "Not every moment is a good moment." The feature should roll out to Facebook users soon, and now you won't have to feel awkward when your casual acquaintance's grandma dies and you want to show your support without getting five billion notifications for the next few days.

London: A freaky, spooky video has gone viral on YouTube and is so scary that chicken-hearted people shouldn't watch it. The video, called 'Selfie from Hell', has gone viral thanks to its inventiveness and all-out scares and has been seen by more than 1.6 million people so far, Mirror.co.uk reported. The video was made by Erdal Ceylan and Meelah Adams, who posted it on their YouTube channel. "I have produced a lot of short films, but it was time for me to start something new; a fresh and exciting project," Meelah, a media production student, was quoted as saying. [embedded content] Thanks to her devotion to a project entitled F*** You Zombie with Erdal, the German residents set out to make Selfie from Hell with their two-man crew. "With 'Selfie from Hell' we wanted to create something creepy, atmospheric, a bit shocking, and above all entertaining. A video, that makes people want to share with others. "The inspiration came from movies like Insidious and The Ring. The language is universal and there's almost no text, so everybody around the world can understand it," Meelah explained. She said she was "highly fascinated" by viral videos. "To analyse that phenomenon and then recreate it myself seemed like the perfect thesis for me. However, I didn't simply want to produce any unrelated viral video, another cat adventure clip,a Meelah said. Friday, September 18, 2

CBS SF Bay (con t) Affordable Care Act Updates: CBSSanFrancisco.com/ACA Health News & Information: CBSSanFrancisco.com/Health CHICAGO (CBS/AP) 〞 New research suggests that half of all U.S. adults have diabetes or pre-diabetes. The study of government health surveys echoes previous research and shows numbers increased substantially between 1988 and 2012 although they mostly leveled off after 2008. Overall, 12 percent to 14 percent of adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2012, the latest data available. Most of that is Type 2 diabetes, the kind linked with obesity and inactivity. Almost 40 percent have pre-diabetes, meaning elevated blood sugar levels that could lead to full-fledged disease. Studies have shown lifestyle changes can delay or prevent diabetes in these people. Whites had lower diabetes rates than Hispanics, blacks and Asian-Americans. The study is based on surveys involving in-home exams and questionnaires. It was published in Tuesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.

By: WCTV Eyewitness News September 14, 2015 VALDOSTA, Ga. -- A Valdosta police officer has been arrested on felony charges and subsequently fired, according to the Valdosta Police Department. Valdosta police say Howard Kent Kirkland was arrested at VPD headquarters on September 10th by the Lanier County Sheriff s Office through a coordinated effort between to two agencies. According to VPD, Kirkland has been charged with felony eavesdropping/surveillance. Police say the crime occurred while he was off-duty at his home in Lanier County. VPD says the Lanier County Sheriff s Office initiated an investigation in June. Kirkland, a 9 year veteran of the Valdosta Police Department, was placed on suspension without pay, pending the outcome of an internal investigation. Kirkland was terminated by VPD Monday. "Based on the internal investigation, it is clear there was sufficient evidence to substantiate the charge against Kirkland and it was determined Kirkland violated several sections of Valdosta Police Department Policy," said Chief Brian Childress of the Valdosta Police Department. "Although I regret it happened, I am proud of the efforts of Lanier County Sheriff's Office to investigate this incident. If we don't police ourselves, we violate the trust of our community."

ARLINGTON, Va. 每 The American Trucking Associations For-Hire truck tonnage index declined 0.9% in August. According to the numbers, in August the index equaled 134.2, down from 135.3 in July. The all-time high of 135.8 was reached this past January. Year over year, the SA index increased 2.1%, which was below the 4% gain in July. Year-to-date through August, compared with the same period last year, tonnage was up 3.3%. "After such a robust July, it is not too surprising that tonnage took a breather in August," said ATA chief economist Bob Costello. "The dip after a strong gain goes with the up and down pattern we've seen this year." Costello added a few factors hurt August's reading, including soft housing starts and falling factory output. "As I said last month, I remain concerned about the high level of inventories throughout the supply chain. This could have a negative impact on truck freight volumes over the next few months," he said.

Pat McCrory. The Legislature completed voting on the two-year spending plan to run state government early Friday just past midnight, when the House agreed the second time to a proposal developed after a nearly three-month standoff between House and Senate Republicans over policy and spending.

The Mercedes-AMG GT S is quite a popular super car that a number of tuning specialists churned out their own impression of the luxury super car. The latest tuner to visually enhance the GT S is Office K, as shown on a report from motorward.com. The modifications made by Office K on the AMG GT S may not be pleasing to the eyes of some industry watchers. In fact, some may even think the enhancements simply messed up a perfectly good-looking car. The Japanese tuning company did not install the aero parts on the AMG GT S since these come together with the Edition 1 variant of the super car. These components include the carbon fiber front spoiler, side skirts, carbon fiber door handles and mirror caps, rear spoiler and the carbon-fiber roof. Office K simply added a protective wrap on the AMG GT S as well as lowered the suspension to accommodate the wheels. These are not ordinary wheels since these are Forgiato FONDARE-ECL rims measuring 20 inches in front and 21 inches at the back. It was a good thing the tuner did not go overboard and gave the wheels the same color as its body. In addition to these light additions, a number of LED lights were also installed by Office K inside the cabin of the Mercedes-AMG GT S.

EP Kings centre JP du Plessis will receive no further sanction after attending a South African Rugby Union (SARU) hearing on Monday. Du Plessis had to appear at the hearing after receiving a red card in his side s Currie Cup clash against the Free State Cheetahs in Elizabeth last Friday. The teleconference hearing was presided over by Advocate Vusi Msiwa, with Du Plessis being represented by EP Rugby chief executive officer Charl Crous. In viewing the incident, Msiwa ruled that the red card given to Du Plessis in the 46th minute of the match was sufficient punishment for the contravention under law 10.4a. He ruled that no further sanction was necessary, which means Du Plessis will be available for selection for the Kings match against the Pumas in Nelspruit on Friday.

AMERICAN companies kept hiring in August despite global market turbulence over the last couple of weeks, according to a survey released yesterday. Strong labour market figures could support the case for a US rate hike this year 每 or even this month 每 although projections for monetary tightening have been pushed back due to worries over China and the strength of the world economy. The ADP report, published ahead of tomorrow's official and more closely-watched non-farm payrolls figures, said that private sector companies added 190,000 people to payrolls last month. The figure disappointed analysts, who had expected more than 200,000 new roles, but was nonetheless higher than July's score of 177,000. Meanwhile the Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book, released last night, said that the economy continued to grow throughout "most" of the country during July and August. "On balance, the September Beige Book suggests that the solid rebound in economic growth seen in the second quarter continued through the summer, but at a more moderate pace than in recent months," said Barclays analyst Jesse Hurwitz. A separate report, also published yesterday, showed that US productivity increased in the second quarter at its fastest rate since 2013. However, Barclays said that it still expects productivity growth to be subdued in the near term.

Strolling through Cambridge can throw up some weird and wonderful sights. This week a bench was spotted resting on another bench outside Cambridge City Council headquarters in the Guildhall - maybe even benches need a sit down. A lonely looking penguin cuddly toy cut a sad figure when it was seen sitting in a wall just in the entrance to Park Street car park looking the worse for wear. Hopefully its owner will return. And a double-take had to be done when walking past a narrowboat moored on Stourbridge Common. From a distance it looks like a real dog standing guard next to the houseboat but on closer inspection it is a life-sized cuddly toy sitting with its pal Shaun the Sheep! Another double-take had to be done for these Cambridge University college gates - that are so cartoon-like they have an optical illusion like appearance If you spot anything weird and wonderful in Cambridge, take a picture and email it to newsdesk@cambridge-news.co.uk.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Negro Digest/Black World published an outstanding body of reviews and essays by black women writers. Nikki Giovanni, June Jordan, Mary Helen Washington, Carolyn Rodgers, Sarah Webster Fabio, Ellease Southerland, Carolyn Fowler, Toni Morrison, Ruth Rambo McClain, Sonia Sanchez, Barbara Christian, and Miriam DeCosta among others produced prose writings for the publication. The publication of their writings in Negro Digest/Black World between the late 1960s and early to mid 1970s makes the production especially notable in retrospect. The works were concentrated in this one venue, raising the value of the periodical and the magazine in turn adding value to the writers publishing record. Related: Blogging about Black World magazine
When it comes between the battle of black and navy blue, black always seems to win for me. But when I visited Urban Outfitters over the summer in San Francisco. Something made me gravitate towards this amazing electric pleated navy blue dress and I'm glad it happened! Thing is, I always wanted to make sure to wear and shoot this dress somewhere sunny and bright so I brought it along with me to Puerto Princesa! The navy blue totally worked, contrasting from the bright and vibrant colors at the resort, it was just nice to see how the colors all came together (if you catch my drift lol)! | Urban Outfitters Navy Blue Dress | Mango Espadrilles Sandals | Aranaz Bag | Swarovski, The Peach Box, Mango and PacSun Bracelets | Joyce Makitalo, H&M and My Gold Rings |

(Reuters) - Shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which recently slipped below their initial offering price after having rocketed 75 percent in their first two months of trading, could lose another 50 percent of their value, Barron s said in the cover story of its Sept. 14 issue. The reasons the weekly financial newspaper gave for the dour outlook: China s struggling economy, increasing competition in e-commerce and more scrutiny of the company s culture and governance. Alibaba spokesman Bob Christie said the article "contains factual inaccuracies and selective use of information, and the conclusions the reporter draws are misleading." The company has posted on the internet a letter to Barron s editor complaining about the story. The company runs two big retail websites and recently warned of lower-than-expected transaction volumes, after having reported that volume growth in the June quarter declined to 34 percent from the 50 percent-plus rates of the past. "That may only worsen as China s economic growth drops to its lowest pace in six years," Barron s said. The recent share price puts a market value on the company of $160 billion. But the stock is trading at about 25 times the average earnings estimate from analysts and Barron s said it should be closer to the 15 times multiple of eBay Inc. Alibaba said in its letter that the price-earnings multiple comparison is flawed and a more appropriate comparison would be to Chinese peers rather than eBay, which does not operate in China.

For a while in the early 80s the hot musical talk was all about "soul" and "passion" (especially in the NME ) and you couldn't move for bands adding horn sections to their records and referencing Marvin Gaye. I'm not sure where it came from 〞 Paul Weller? Paul Young? Spandau Ballet? 〞 but there was a definite shift to more classic soul influences which was soon exploited by the Levi's 501 commercials. It was something of a conservative step backwards from post-punk but I still liked a lot of the records. Even the indie world was influenced by this trend. The Kane Gang were a trio from Newcastle whose first single "Brother, Brother" came out on the small Kitchenware label (home of Prefab Sprout) in 1983. Like a lot of British blue-eyed-soul it sounds a bit weedy next to the records that influenced it and is more "Indie Funk" than Funkadelic but it has a good groove, especially in this rare longer 12∪ version.

NEW YORK 〞 Opening night of the New York Philharmonic s 174th season brought music and a ribbon-cutting ceremony, and the announcement of the largest individual donation in the orchestra s history. The New York Times reports (http://nyti.ms/1OxT4Fg ) Oscar Schafer, chairman of the Philharmonic s board, and his wife presented the $25 million gift Thursday in the newly re-named David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center. Schafer says he hopes his donation inspires more gifts from his fellow board members. Officials say Schafer s donation, along with $100 million pledged by Geffen, signifies that the orchestra s longtime plans to renovate their concert hall are taking shape. Repairs are expected to cost over $500 million. Schafer says he fell in love with classical music when he heard Beethoven s "Archduke" in a music class at Harvard University.

The federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday rejected an emergency request from 15 states and Peabody Energy Corp. to temporarily block the sweeping plan that would require states to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants. West Virginia and other coal-reliant states have been leading opposition to the plan, which would mandate a 32 percent cut in emissions nationwide by 2030. The Environmental Protection Agency and the White House have said they believe the limits are legal and rejected an earlier request to put them on hold.

A survey of 62 institutional investors by Evercore ISI shows that two out of three believe it will not be possible to invest in Volkswagen over the next half year if the financial risks linked to its emissions scandal remain unclear. A survey of 62 institutional investors by Evercore ISI shows that two out of three believe it will not be possible to invest in Volkswagen over the next half year if the financial risks linked to its emissions scandal remain unclear. "Sixty-six percent of investors responded that it is not possible to invest in VW over the next 6 months if costs, fines, legal and criminal proceedings are outstanding or inadequately quantified," Evercore analyst Arndt Ellinghorst wrote in a research note. The survey, published on Tuesday, also showed that 76 percent of investors believe that VW should spin off its trucks business, while 62 percent said the ocmpany had too many brands, suggesting the group needs streamlining. Evercore did not make clear in its note when the survey was conducted and was not immediately available to comment on the timing.
As a postscript to yesterday's CC of the Mercedes 300 , here's the rarest version of them all; well that and the 300 Popemobile. This is a custom-built station wagon built by the German coach builder Binz, at the request of a very wealthy American woman, Carolyn Ryan, who wanted a station wagon built to her very high standards to haul her luggage from her Palm beach mansion to her yacht. And she got one. Not only was it used in Palm Beach in the winters, but then every spring she had it shipped to Europe, to use on the French Riviera and Baden-Baden, Germany. It would have probably been cheaper to order a second one to keep in Europe, but money obviously was not an issue. Ms. Ryan, granddaughter of the founder of American Tobacco, was married and divorced thrice. And was very particular about everything in her life; probably a bit too much so for her husbands. The rear load area is a two level affair, with the top level at the same height as the folded seatbacks. Binz had experience building ambulances and hearses on the 300 chassis in Germany. When she asked her NYC neighbor, Mercedes importer Max Hoffman about her desire to have a 300 wagon, Binz was the obvious choice. Although this is the only 300 station wagon, Binz went on to build many station wagons on lesser Mercedes chassis. Just needs some Di-Noc fake wood on the sides＃

INDORE: A 35-year-old man allegedly slit his mother s throat after a scuffle over killing the sacrificial animal in Palalwadi village of Shajapur district on Thursday. The incident took place on the eve of Eid-ul-Zuha at 7:30pm when Irshad s mother rebuked him for killing the goat, which was kept for sacrifice. The quarrel escalated into a fight. Irshad, in a fit of rage, first beat up his mother and then slit her throat using the same knife that he had used on the goat. The woman started bleeding profusely and was rushed to a local hospital by family members, but was declared brought dead, said Shajapur police. "Irshad was a drunkard and unemployed. He often got into fights with family members over monetary issues. On Thursday, Irshad asked his mother to get some money from his step-brother Sayeed. When his mother refused, the fight ensued," said head constable Ramprasad. Irshad fled the scene after committing the crime but was arrested by police from Tanki Chouraha. "A case was registered against the accused under Section 302 (murder) of IPC. He was produced before court on Friday," said superintendent of police (SP) Anil Sharma.

Opposition groups Saturday vowed to challenge laws passed overnight that clear Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War II, saying the changes are a "black stain" on the country s history. Japan s ruling coalition, led by nationalist Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, pushed the laws through in the early hours of the morning after days of tortuous debate that at points descended into physical scuffles in parliament. For the first time in 70 years, the new laws will give the government the power to send the military into overseas conflicts to defend allies, even if Japan itself is not under attack.

Crunch time for the Aussie dollar 3:08 The Australian dollar has dropped to a new six-year low and could have as much as another US10c to fall QUEENSLAND had the worst performing domestic economy out of every state, new figures have revealed. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show Queensland's state final demand shrunk 0.8 per cent during the June quarter which follows a 0.2 per cent contraction. The two consecutive quarters of negative growth are not technically a recession because the figures do not include Queensland's extensive exports. However, the state's domestic position has deteriorated while NSW, Victoria and Western Australia all improved. Only the Northern Territory incurred a worse result than Queensland. Opposition treasury spokesman John-Paul Langbroek said while the state was not in recession, it was clear the Government's lack of a plan was hurting. "Unfortunately, today's figures are the latest in a series of economic releases that show Queensland is falling behind the rest of the pack,' he said. "The latest trend building approvals released this week have declined for five consecutive months, compared to 10 straight months of growth just prior to the January election. "Last week's Sensis business survey showed net confidence in Queensland is the lowest in the nation. "This goes to show Labor is more focused on reviewing projects and internal squabbles than growing the economy and delivering more jobs for Queenslanders."

LONDON (ShareCast) - (ShareCast News) - Union Jack Oil (LSE: UJO.L - news ) is well placed to benefit of a "dislocation" within the oil gas and industry, according to group chief executive David Bramhill. Bramhill s comments came as the company reported a 256,038 loss for the six months to 30 June, while net assets rose 58.3% year-on-year to 3.8m. In a statement released on Monday, the London-listed group, which is still to generate any revenue, added it ended the period debt free and with 2.5m of cash resources available. "The company s strategy is to continue focusing on its low-cost UK onshore portfolio and similar opportunities, with a view to generating additional value for its shareholders," Bramhill said. "To that end the company has already utilised its robust balance sheet position to increase its interests in drill-ready projects at Biscathorpe and North Kelsey and to acquire an interest in the producing Keddington oilfield at an attractive entry point post period end." The group said that its current planned drill programme was fully funded. Union Jack shares were up 1.13% to 0.162p at 0844 BST on Monday.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny expressed his delight when presented with a daring new calendar, created in aid of mental health, at the Ploughing Championships today. Glamorous Marita Kelly from Waterford says she was happy to step outside her comfort zone for the tongue-in-cheek calendar, once it helps to raise awareness about mental health issues. "Obviously at the start you think oh, God. But there isn't a person in the country who hasn't been affected by suicide," she told independent.ie. "Obviously stockings and suspenders are not my everyday attire but the main thing is that we got people talking about the cause because it's scary to talk about it." "One of my good friends who is male, suffers from depression, and he would be one of the boys 每 one of the lads' lads." "He was very supportive, and my family and friends are the first people I go to about everything. Created in partnership with St Patrick s Mental Health Service s Walk In My Shoes campaign, the limited-edition calendar is on sale at the Macra stand of the Ploughing Championships in Ratheniska, Co Laois, this week. Enda Kenny dropped by the Macra stand this morning, and Marita said he was "very supportive" of the good cause. "The main thing was that we all enjoyed it," she said.

Witnesses and security officials from both sides of the conflict said Sunday s airstrikes destroyed a key rebel encampment in downtown Sanaa, hitting a school, several restaurants and the nearby Saudi and Emirati embassies. Yemen is torn by fighting between the rebels known Houthis and their allies against exiled President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi s coalition-backed forces.

Vernon Middle School students learning how to take notes? Vernon Middle School is in its third year of the AVID Program. The AVID Program helps students in multiple different ways with their educational needs. One of the major parts of AVID is learning how to take Cornell Notes in classes. With this being the first year that 6th grade students are in middle school, they are having to learn how to take Cornell Notes. Every student is required to take Cornell Notes in every class. The Cornell Notes help students develop their own study guide in the process of learning the curriculum. In Ms. Deborah Schoen's 6th grade Science class, Ms. Holly Bare, 8th grade AVID and Science Teacher, brought her 8th grade students in to help 6th grade students learn how to find the information to develop their Cornell Notes. The 6th grade Science classes were learning about Forms of Energy. Ms. Bare began explaining to students how the lesson was presented, where to find the essential question(s), numbering the paragraphs, and writing the main idea for each. Ms. Bare along with her 8th grade students, helped guide the 6th grade students through the process of Cornell Note taking. At the end of each class period, the 6th grade students thanked Ms. Bare and her 8th grade students for coming to help them understand the process of taking Cornell Notes.
Every thing is fine folks, nothing to be worried about. Your government has every thing under control. http://www.foxnews.c...-at-least-2012/ While President Obama early last year, in an interview with The New Yorker, referred to ISIS as the "JV team," and has described Al Qaeda as "decimated," Nunes suspicions were further confirmed by a 2013 incident at Florida s U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). Analysts at CENTCOM -- which oversees 20 nations, including Syria, Iraq and Pakistan -- were tasked with reviewing the documents recovered from Usama bin Laden s compound during the Navy SEALs raid. In May 2013, Nunes went to Florida for a briefing on the documents, but the intelligence analysts he expected to meet were not there. Instead, the congressman was told the analysts were not working on a Saturday, which apparently was not true. "We found out not only were they there, they were prepared to brief -- someone has to answer as to why they did not let us have access to those analysts," Nunes explained. The message that the analysts were not available was delivered by Maj. Gen. Scott D. Berrier, who headed the intelligence wing, but the congressman said the interference had to come from higher up. A source close to some of the analysts indicated the manipulation of intelligence began on Berrier s watch. There was no immediate comment from Berrier, who is now commanding general, U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence & Fort Huachuca.

Great British Bake Off co-host Sue Perkins has thanked fans for their support after revealing she has a brain tumour that means she cannot have children. The presenter was diagnosed with prolactinoma, a non-cancerous tumour, eight years ago during a check-up while filming television show The Supersizers about diets throughout history. She went online to assure people she is alright, tweeting: "Ta for sweet tweets about my prolactinoma. It s benign & non-symptomatic. All fine, Let s focus on those less fortunate in the world." The 45-year-old, who hosts the hit baking show alongside long-time friend Mel Giedroyc, said living with the condition can be a challenge. "Sometimes it s big and makes me mad, and sometimes it s small and is in the background," she told Good Housekeeping magazine. "Sometimes it screws up my hormones. I have various tests now to make sure the side effects aren t too onerous." Perkins said being told she would not be able to have children was difficult. Share article She said: "I don t know if I would have gone on to have children. But as soon as someone says you can t have something, you want it more than anything." She added that Giedroyc giving birth to her first child made her acutely aware that she will not be able to experience motherhood.

Matteo Darmian looked to be thrilled as the Manchester United defender was named the club's player of the month for August. The defender, who joined the Red Devils from Torino this summer, was voted as the club's top performer during the first few weeks of the season by the club's fans. The right-back won the prize with 42 per cent of the vote after impressing as he made his first few appearances in the English Premier League. And the Italy international looked to be in good spirits as he posed for a picture with the award on Thursday afternoon. Darmian will be hoping to feature when United return to Premier League action against Liverpool at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon. The Red Devils head into the clash on the back of their surprise 2-1 loss to Swansea City before the international break. Louis van Gaal's men are currently fifth in the Premier League table after taking seven points from their opening four games.

PITTSBURGH 每 A lawyer for a former western Pennsylvania medical researcher convicted in the cyanide poisoning death of his neurologist wife is seeking a new trial. Sixty-six-year-old Robert Ferrante is serving life in prison since an Allegheny County jury convicted him last fall in the April 2013 death of Dr. Autumn Klein. He has since appealed his conviction. The Pittsburgh Tribune Review reports attorney Chris Eyster said Tuesday he plans to use information from scientists who say that leftover chemicals from creatine that Klein was taking could have produced a false positive for cyanide in her blood tests. Eyster also argues that the court erred by not granting Ferrante a hearing after sentencing when the state allegedly failed to disclose problems with the lab that performed the tests.

by The Sefarina, a seagoing ship operated by the Dutch company Chemgas Shipping, has scored another "first" in the port of Antwerp. After being the first ship to obtain a particulates discount, on Monday it was also the first seagoing vessel to be bunkered with LNG in the port of Antwerp. Bunkering with this cleaner type of fuel has already been possible in Antwerp for some time, but so far it has been used only for barges, with the LNG being supplied by trucks. The recent truck-to-ship bunkering of the Sefarina now counts as a test case for the safety procedures that will apply to bunkering of seagoing ships. Truck-to-ship bunkering LNG bunkering in the port of Antwerp has been available since 2012. A truck collects LNG at the LNG import terminal in Zeebrugge and brings it to the quay in Antwerp where it is pumped into the ship, a procedure known as truck-to-ship bunkering. LNG is a much cleaner fuel in comparison to diesel. The exhaust from a ship driven by LNG contains hardly any particulates, while emissions of NOx are also dramatically lower. Permanent facility As part of its sustainability policy Antwerp Port Authority aims not only to encourage the use of LNG as ship s fuel but also to facilitate it. The Port Authority therefore seeks a candidate to build and operate an LNG bunkering and filling station under a concession on quay 528. The aim is for barges to be able to bunker with LNG in the port of Antwerp at a permanent facility by the beginning of 2019 at the latest. Sep 15, 2

There s no sleeping in on Saturdays if you re an Oklahoma football fan It keeping up with what has been a modern trend, the game between the Oklahoma Sooners and Texas Longhorns on Saturday October 10th has been set for an 11:00 am kickoff. For planning purposes only. First things first, we ve got to StripeTheStadium and BeatWVU! pic.twitter.com/S7LnIQLdQU 〞 Oklahoma Football (@OU_Football) September 28, 2015 The Sooners are 3-0 to start the season and will be looking to remain undefeated when they host 23 West Virginia this Saturday in Norman. The Longorns are looking to get back on track but will have the tall task of playing 4 TCU in Ft. Worth. Texas is 1-3 on the season and very much in turmoil. The early kickoff at the Cotton Bowl, in Dallas, will mark Oklahoma s third consecutive 11:00 am start this season. The Sooners hosted Tulsa on September 19th for an early kick and will do the same thing this weekend for the Mountaineers. I guess there s still some positives you can draw out of the early starts. If you re driving home after the game you should have plenty of time to get back before it s too late. You ll also have the opportunity to watch plenty of other football if you re staying home.

InventHelp, a leading inventor service company, is submitting the BACK SEAT SENSOR to companies for their review. PITTSBURGH, PA (PRWEB) September 12, 2015 "I heard too many horror stories about parents leaving their children behind in a car when it was blazing hot or freezing cold," said an inventor from Cape Coral, Fla. "I have heard of dog owners doing the same. I wanted to develop a way to keep this from ever happening again." She developed the patent-pending BACK SEAT SENSOR to prevent a child or pet from being left in a vehicle unattended. The system ensures that a child or pet is not stranded in a vehicle parked outdoors in the cold or heat. This helps reduce the risk of injury and/or death, which is designed to enhance personal safety. The invention provides added peace of mind to parents and caregivers. Also, it is adaptable for use in any vehicle. The original design was submitted to the Tampa office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers. For more information, write Dept. 14-TPA-2101, InventHelp, 217 Ninth Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, or call (412) 288-1300 ext. 1368.

[Brigham Young Sermon] [Pres] Young, gave most wholesome instructions to the people living far out at sea, from other settlements from whom they could obtain help in times of Indian uprises, only when it would be too late to render any material assistance. The whites were cautioned to give the Indian full value for his skins, furs, pine nuts and labor, and not take advantage of his ignorance as to the value of articles. The Indians are to be taught the science of agriculture, and the young ones their letters, the phonetic way of spelling, and the english language. The spirit, teachings and examples, only in a far more liberal sense, of William Penn are to characterize the dealings of the Kanab and other settlements of the Saints, with their dark skinned brethren, the Lamanites. -- Kanab, Utah [Source: Deseret News, quoted in The Complete Discourses of Brigham Young, Ed.

(CNN) -- A mother, her newborn, and a pastor were shot Sunday in an Alabama church, and the baby s father is in custody, authorities said. James Junior Minter, 26, is accused of opening fire inside the Oasis Tabernacle Church in Selma, Alabama. He faces three counts of attempted murder, Dallas County District Attorney Michael Jackson told CNN. "The mother is in critical condition. She and the baby were sent to Birmingham for medical treatment. The pastor is at a local hospital in Selma," Jackson said. The pastor was shot as he tried to get the gun out of the shooter s hand, he said. According to a statement from Selma police, Minter entered the church and sat between his child and the mother, who was his girlfriend. He started shooting soon after. The girlfriend was shot in the shoulder and the jaw, police say. Her child was shot in the hand. The pastor, who police say grabbed Minter and helped to subdue him, was shot in the leg. Minter allegedly fled the scene but was captured by police less than a mile from the church. Possible motives in the shooting may have been a dispute over child visitation and ongoing domestic violence between Minter and his girlfriend, police said in their statement.

The 2015 hybrid cloud market report segments the industry based on delivery model into IaaS, PaaS and SaaS while focusing on high adoption of hybrid cloud by SMEs as one of the growing market trends across the globe. One of the most important trends in cloud computing is the availability of hybrid cloud market solutions from various service providers. For instance, Fujitsu offers hybrid cloud services based on Microsoft Windows Azure, which enables interoperability between applications and systems. The service is offered for different scenarios, including when a business needs additional resources in the public cloud to support heavy workload. The hybrid cloud market service offered by Fujitsu also addresses the issue of enterprises having to rely on multiple cloud vendors. According to this 2015 hybrid cloud market report, organizations are focusing on hybrid cloud as it provides the benefits of both private and public cloud models. It also provides IT infrastructure and application support to enterprises at a low cost. Therefore, with the adoption of hybrid cloud market services, enterprises are reducing their capital and operational expenditure on IT infrastructure. Further, the report states that the organizations are concerned about data security and compliance issues while using solutions of the hybrid cloud market. This is of particular concern when it involves SaaS-based solutions because of the chances of data leakage from cloud servers.
More than 150 tailors in Saudi Arabia are racing against time to embroider nearly 120kg of gold strings on a giant silk piece of cloth, called kiswah , so it will be draped around Kaaba, Islam's holiest shrine, during the upcoming pilgrimage. The kiswah, Arabic for pall, will have a length of around 45 metres and a height of 14 metres. Parts of the gold and silver threads on top of the kiswah will read: "There is no God but Allah, Mohammed (PBUH) is the Messenger of Allah." "The kiswah this time will have more than 700kg of silk, 120kg of gold strings and 25kg of silver strings," said Mohammed bin Abdullah, Director of the kiswah factory in the Western town of Makkah, where Kaaba is situated. Quoted by Al Riyadh and other Saudi newspapers, he said work on the kiswah takes several weeks and is normally finished a few days ahead of the Haj (pilgrimage). He did not mention costs of the new kiswah, but last year it cost around SR17 million (Dh17 million), according to Saudi officials. Kiswah is the cloth that covers Kaaba, where more than three million Muslim pilgrims converge for the annual Haj, which is expected to start on Sept 23.
Southampton boss Ronald Koeman feels his side need to be more clinical in front of goal if they are to pick up wins away from home. Saints have not won in the Premier League away from St Mary s since February, a run that has now stretched to 10 games after the goalless stalemate at West Brom at the weekend. Koeman s side are unbeaten on their travels this season, with three draws from as many games, but the Dutchman wants Southampton to return to winning ways on their travels. He told the Daily Echo: "The third away game we didn t lose, but every time one point is not enough. "You like to win, make bigger steps on the table, but, again, if you can t win, don t lose a game and that s at least one point we didn t have last year." Saints have failed to score in three of their five Premier League games this term and Koeman admits his side must be more clinical in front of goal. He said: "The best chance [against Albion] maybe was in the first half for Jay Rodriguez, and not good enough in the final part in attacking, not clinical enough. "Sometimes we make too difficult choices in our final pass."
answers viewers Twitter questions from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, offering his thoughts on VeriFone Systems (PAY), Netflix (NFLX), Freshpet (FRPT), and which pharmaceutical stocks to buy. Cramer was asked if Hillary Clinton s comments about the pharmaceutical industry would have a long-term effect on health care stocks. Cramer responded that her message is that drug companies are what you beat up on, so I would be careful and recognize the stocks do not reflect her negative opinion yet. He added that the two pharma stocks he recommends are Eli Lilly (LLY) and Bristol Myers (BMY). Another viewer wanted to know if VeriFone would find a catalyst in the new EMV requirement, which requires major credit card companies to equip cards with chip technology as an increased security measure. Cramer said he thought VeriFone would get a lift from that, but in the current market environment, it s not. Cramer noted VeriFone s last quarter was good. Cramer was also asked if Netflix is a buy, hold or sell. He answered that investors should buy the stock when its below 94 or 95.

Michelle Dockery said it "feels like the right time" for Downton Abbey to end Downton Abbey s leading lady said it is right to call time on the award-winning period drama. Michelle Dockery, who plays Lady Mary Crawley, said there were "many tears shed" as the cast filmed Downton s last ever scenes, with the final series due to begin on ITV at 9pm today. Fans have been torn over whether the drama could continue, while creator Julian Fellowes hinted last month that the show could have an afterlife on the big screen. In an interview with the Sunday Express S magazine, Dockery said it "feels like the right time" for the curtain call. She said: "I almost think that if we d carried on, we d be stepping into new territory, going into the late 1920s. "It s good to end on a high note and before there were real changes beginning to occur, politically and socially." Downton Abbey is back for a sixth and final series tonight with a 90-minute episode set in 1925, featuring talk of a wedding, intrigue, and uncertainty over the future of the estate.

Alyssa Milano said she isn't going to let her critics get her down after she faced backlash this week for posting pictures of herself breastfeeding her 1-year-old daughter. "I don't care," the "Charmed" actress told Entertainment Tonight. "I'm going to keep breastfeeding, maybe even until [Elizabella is] 6!" Ms. Milano , 42, said it's "crazy" how differently people reacted to her photos, versus when Miley Cyrus flashed her nipple on live television at the MTV Video Music Awards. "Everyone's fine with her nipples being out," she lamented. "I think people are more comfortable sexualizing breasts than relating them to what they were made for, which is feeding another human." Ms. Milano gushed about her children to ET as she promoted her new line of designer paper towels for Viva. She also has 4-year-old son Milo with husband David Bugliari. "When you have these babies, that connection is so meant to be and so profound," she said. "You look at them and you go, 'Oh, this is why. This is why I went through everything in my life.'"
By Sept. 10, 2015, 4:55 p.m. MAIN Roads has criticised road contractors who painted over a dead animal on the Mt Lindesay Highway, describing the work as not up to standard. The department has demanded the contractor fix the line marking immediately, at its own expense. WARNING: Confronting images below The dead animal was painted over where it lay in the centre of the highway at Gleneagle, when a road crew was remarking the highway. A Main Roads spokesman said the animal should have been moved before the works were done. "We pride ourselves on the delivery of high-quality outcomes and appreciate this being brought to our attention," he said. "We are disappointed with this line marking, undertaken by a third party on our behalf, on the Mount Lindesay Highway at Woodhill because our standards were not met." The animal's remains have since been removed from the road. To report road concerns, call 13 19 40. Road workers painted over this dead animal when remarking the centre line on the Mt Lindesay Highway. The animal s remains have now been removed. Jimboomba Times, Qld
Filtering through a massive amount of political information on the Internet can be crushing. But what if apps in social media-centric elections could help voters make informed decisions? Campaign apps A small digital agency called CanDo recently produced Rand Paul's official campaign app. The technology lets users take selfies with Paul, interact with friends, share ideas about campaign positions, donate money and even play a secret arcade game to destroy Jeb Bush and Donald Trump campaign logos. Fast Company interviewed CanDo CEO, Rob Ratterman, who explained via email that "developing apps for candidates is different from developing an app for, say, a corporate client".
Forget snakes on a plane. An escaped tarantula delayed a Delta plane flying from Baltimore to Atlanta on Wednesday night. The spider caused chaos on Flight 1525 when baggage handlers noticed the baboon tarantula out of its carrier container in the cargo hold. The captain ordered the plane grounded in Baltimore overnight to be searched for any additional arachnids, reported The Baltimore Sun . "They were able to capture it, and they contacted the handler" to ensure it was the only spider in the cage, Delta spokesman Brian Kruse said. Passengers were taken off the plane and put on another flight, which departed about three hours later, Kruse said. The spider was confined to the cargo hold and never entered the cabin, but officials were taking no chances. "Safety and security are our top priority," Kruse added. The flight was supposed to take off from Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport at 7 p.m. and arrive at Hartsfield-Jackson International just after 9 p.m. lhanna@nydailynews.com

Vincent van Gogh s "Landscape Under a Stormy Sky" could fetch over $70 million in Nov. 5 auction at Sotheby s. The landscape was made during van Gogh s "Arles" period, one year before his death. During an auction last year, Sotheby s sold another landscape by van Gogh from the same period for $66.3 million. "Portrait of Dr. Gatchet," holds the auction record for being the most expensive of van Gogh s work sold, fetching $82.5 million at a Christie s auction in 1990. The evening auction will include 10 works, with van Gogh s landscape the marquee item. A painting by Pablo Picasso, "Nu au Jambes crois谷es," will also take the auction floor that evening and is estimated to be worth between $8 million to $12 million. Earlier this year, Picasso s "Women of Algiers" was sold for a record-breaking $172 million at Christie s. The painting from Picasso s later period perplexed and fumed many as the work was said to belong to a less esteemed period by the artist, with a New York Times piece describing the sale as a showcase for rising inequality.

On Thursday, 24 September 2015, at my home (in Northfield, Rice County, Minnesota), a Yellow-rumped Warbler caught my eye in my banding net. The throat and belly were yellowish. The throat color did not wrap around the auricular feathers (ear patches). The wing bars were relatively wide. Finally, the eye-strip is very faint. I believe this bird is a young Audubon's Warbler, the western race of the Yellow-rumped. Last spring, you may recall, I banded a bird I thought to be a hybrid between the two races. As I mentioned in that previous post, about a half dozen Audubon Warbler records exist from Minnesota.

Republican presidential hopefuls (L-R), Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, real estate magnate Donald Trump, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and former CEO Carly Fiorina, listen as retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson (C) speaks during the presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Wednesday. CNN has come under scrutiny for the way it handled its GOP 2016 debate Wednesday night, with a steady stream of critics alleging that the network exploited Donald Trump's popularity in making him the spotlight of the event. "Last night was three hours of asking Donald Trump questions," one such critic, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, said Thursday during his "Morning Joe" program. "Asking other candidates what they thought about Donald Trump, and then when other candidates answered what they thought about Donald Trump, showing a split-screen with Donald Trump ＃ It was just non-stop Donald Trump," he said. "It was not a serious debate," he added. "It was a full-on obsession with Donald Trump. They did a disservice to anyone who was watching that."

The idea is to tell a story; not to shock, much less to scandalize. If the act of making and narrating stories takes them to forgotten lanes and forbidden subjects. So be it.

Benedict Cumberbatch was initially wary of taking on the role of Sherlock Holmes. Although the 39-year-old actor has won critical acclaim and praise from fans for his portrayal of the famous detective in BBC One s Sherlock , Benedict admitted he wasn t sure if the part was right for him. He told CNN International: I was very wary having done roles which were challenging and terrific and, you know, kept a good career going. I was very wary about stepping into the limelight and the populist role like Sherlock Holmes but the minute I saw who was involved and read the script and the quality of it I thought, I ve got to do this . Hopefully I haven t left being a respected actor behind by playing Sherlock. And he admitted that knowing people are hugely invested in the fictional character, was daunting. He said: I was just going from great jobs but they weren t in the limelight. They weren t in the public eye quite to the extent that I knew that character, no matter what we did with it, was going to garner that kind of attention. 
Re: FNG;2T in sight test questions by GARRYOWEN Thu Sep 10, 2015 12:37 pm Sam, I thought I would wait until Darby had a chance to respond as they are his rules, but here goes from me. After all the firing and reactions have been completed from the In Sight Tests caused by a group s movement, the active player may continue his remaining movement (if any) with any figures who are able. The active player s figures in that group may also take their active fire, provided they have not been hit, are not out of ammo, have not ducked back, and they have a target to shoot at. Then melees as you say. (I rarely ever have melees at home so I tend to forget them. At conventions, the guys like to melee more). Actually, I think melees happen when they happen. Remember one group is moved at a time and the In Sight Tests caused by that group s movement (and any resulting fire and reaction tests) are resolved, followed by any remaining movement, fire and reaction tests (as described in the previous paragraph). Then proceed to the next group and go through the sequence. Then the other side activates as described above. Then you roll for the next activation. If I screwed this up, hopefully Darby will come by to correct me. Even if I have not screwed it up, he could probably say it better than I. Great rules. Very realistic and exciting to play. Tom

A Pakistani Taliban suicide bomber blew himself up near a vehicle carrying an area commander of the tribal police in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, killing four people and wounding at least 52, authorities said. The attacker, who was on foot, targeted area commander Tehsinullah Khan as his vehicle came out of the headquarters of the tribal police in Jamrud, government administrator Fahad Wazir said. He said Khan survived the attack, but was wounded. Pakistani Taliban spokesman Mohammad Khurasani later claimed the bombing and vowed in a statement to carry out more attacks in the future. Wazir said two tribal police officers and two civilians were killed in the attack and that some of the wounded were listed in critical condition at a government hospital. "Our security forces have been carrying out a major operation against militants. This operation will continue until the terrorists are eliminated," he said. Jamrud is located 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney says he is seeking to override Gov. Chris Christie s veto of a bill requiring law enforcement agencies be notified when a person applies to expunge mental health records in order to buy a gun. Sweeney said Wednesday the Democrat-led state Senate would vote on override later this month. The legislation passed unanimously in June. Lawmakers say the bill ensures judges get all relevant information including pending charges before ruling on a record. Christie conditionally vetoed the measure in August, saying it could further confuse a cumbersome area of law. Christie instead called for implementing a plan that includes possible involuntary commitment of those whose could be considered dangerous if their illness were untreated.

Chrissie Hynde is philosophical about being raped by the outlaw bikers she hung out with as a youngster. The Pretenders rocker, 63, has written in her memoirs, Reckless: My Life As A Pretender, about how she was beaten, robbed and raped by the gang. In an interview to air on this week's Sunday Morning on CBS, Chrissie said: "If you hung out with those guys, that's what happened. That's the way it was." The singer has written about the experience in her memoirs (Yui Mok/PA) The singer said she didn't fear for her life, though she should have. "We were just trying to score pot and see bands," she explained. "And if motorcycles were part of it, then even better." But things could easily get out of hand.

Warships deployed with Operation Atalanta are able to remain at sea to protect World Food Programme (WFP) vessels and conduct counter-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean due to the vital support that they receive from re-supply vessels, such as USNS Carl Brashear (US) and RFA Fort Victoria (UK). Over the past weeks both vessels have supplied EU Naval Force warships with much-needed fuel, food and stores. A replenishment at sea (RAS) is a highly complex and potentially dangerous manoeuvre due to the close proximity that the ships need to come to, and importantly remain at, in order to transfer fuel hoses and other supply lines. On 2 September ESPS Meteoro received fuel from the USNS Carl Brashear, whilst RFA Fort Victoria replenished HNLMS Groningen.
Reuters 每 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Friday said Russian President Vladimir Putin has told him that Moscow wants to play a more active role in combating Islamic State and other militant groups, but added there was no coalition with Russia. "I do not see a coalition between Iran and Russia on fighting terrorism in Syria," Rouhani, in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, told a group of senior editors from media organizations.

Last week, I received a new trademark solicitation regarding a trademark registration renewal. The company calls itself "Patent & Trademark Office" with an address in New York, NY. See the image of their mailing that I scanned below. The document could easily be mistaken as coming from the government 每 the "Patent & Trademark Office" name, the look and feel of the document, and the official looking bar code. Their "fee" of $975 is not cheap. And it is not clear what services they provide? Is this a Section 8 renewal, or 8 and 15? Do they provided legal advice about which renewal is appropriate, and whether the mark is in use or in use for all the goods and services in the registration? Are they attorneys and members of the bar? If this was a legitimate service at a reasonable value, why would they mask who they are, and why would they choose the clearly deceptive name of "Patent & Trademark Office"? Their website appears to be patenttrademarkoffice.us, but the domain was not working when I checked it this week. Beware of such scams. Read the fine print. Contact your attorney. Report scams to the FTC and USPTO. For more information, see: How to avoid being taken by a trademark scam WARNING: Non-USPTO Solicitations That May Resemble Official USPTO Communications
A data protection breach at Thomson, a British travel firm, has led to the accidental exposure of more than 450 customers' personal information. Passenger details, including home addresses, telephone numbers, names and flight information, were unintentionally disclosed in an email, which the company said it quickly recalled. Thomson released a statement apologizing for the "genuine error." However, the company noted it would not be offering affected customers with any compensation. "We are aware of an email that was sent in error, which shared a small number of customers' information," read the statement. "The error was identified very quickly and the email was recalled, which was successful in a significant number of cases. We would like to apologize to our customers involved and reassure them that we take data security very seriously. We are urgently investigating the matter to ensure the situation will not be repeated." The email containing the personal information of 458 Thomson customers from around the UK was reportedly sent on August 15. The travel company did not announce details of how the breach occurred. The news comes shortly after the massive breach of the extramarital affairs website Ashley Madison, in which the data of about 39 million subscribers was recently leaked online. The company is now facing a $578 million class-action lawsuit filed last week by two Canadian firms.

The European Commission on Tuesday said it has concluded that Finland s plans to grant EUR 23 million of public funding for the construction of a small scale LNG terminal at Pori, in the Satakunta region on Finland s west coast, are compatible with EU state aid rules. The project aims to encourage the use of LNG as fuel for ships, in place of fuel oils and liquefied petroleum gases. The Commission concluded that the project contributes to environmental protection and to the security of gas supply in Finland whilst maintaining competition in the Single Market. Seeking to end the energy isolation of the Baltic Sea Region and to integrate it fully into the EU energy markets is a key building block for the EU s Energy Union strategy and one of the key priorities of the Juncker Commission. EU Commissioner in charge of competition policy Margrethe Vestager said: "The LNG terminal in Pori is the first of its kind in Finland. It will provide a new source of cleaner fuel for the maritime industry and diversify Finland s gas supply sources. It is a good example of how EU state aid rules can encourage sound public investment that helps the EU reach its goals on energy security and environmental protection." by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News

University of South Florida football coach Willie Taggart has declared Tampa s Ybor City neighborhood off-limits for his team after the fatal stabbing of a former player. Former USF defensive lineman Elkino Watson, 23, died Sunday. Police said the stabbing happened after a fight near a Ybor City nightclub. On Monday s American Athletic Conference teleconference, Taggert said his players will "have to find other places to go have fun" instead of going to the historic entertainment district. Watson played for USF from 2011-2014. Taggart said his team was shaken by Watson s death a few hours after his visit with the Bulls following their game against Florida A&M. Taggart said USF players will wear stickers honoring Watson. A memorial service is scheduled Tuesday on campus for USF players.
New Delhi, Sept 21 (PTI) Senior officials of Northern Railway led by General Manger AK Puthia today carried out a detailed inspection of Kalka-Shimla toy train line to prevent any possible mishap in the section. Two British nationals were killed and 10 others injured when three coaches of the toy train on the Kalka-Shimla narrow gauge section derailed near Parwanoo between the Kalka and Taksal stations on September 12. The derailment assumed importance as it caused death of two foreign tourists and also raised concern about the safety of the train operation on the narrow gauge section. However, a senior Northern Railway official said "the derailment occurred at around 12.55 pm on September 12 and the train service resumed next day. The service was affected for a day only and now it is absolutely normal." Alarmed by the spate of accidents, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu took an urgent safety review meeting on September 14 and asked all zonal chiefs to ensure zero-level accident. Railways have suspended three employees including two drivers after the derailment while ordering an inquiry. During the day long inspection, Puthia inspected curve no 14 between Kalka and Taksal, tunnel no 13 and its side drain, catch water drain, curve no 343, point and crossing at Barog station. The Kalka Shimla narrow gauge railway section has been inscribed as world heritage site since 2008 by UNESCO. An engineering feat of highest skills comprising 102 tunnels and 869 bridges, the 96.60 km long section was opened for traffic on November 9 19

Manchester City are once again hoping to get one over on bitter rivals Manchester United by securing a deal for midfielder Thiago Alcantara. The Bayern Munich playmaker was heavily linked with a move to the Premier league in 2013 before joining the Bundesliga outfit from Barcelona, but opted for Germany instead. At the time United and City were both keen on landing the Spanish international, but according to the Daily Star , City are now ready to revive their interest in the 24-year-old. Thiago is highly rated by manager Pep Guardiola but with a number of injury problems hampering his availability in the past 18 months a fresh start could be just one option for the midfielder. The paper have claimed that City sporting director Txiki Begiristain has confirmed his admiration for the player, and that a deal could be a possibility. City looked to have started the season like a house on fire but having stuttered in the past fortnight they could now look for new recruits to continue their title push.

See Also Refilling the pipeline The banks that energy companies depend on for loans are pulling back from the sector. Oil prices plummeted in late 2014, and have remained low. Energy companies often borrow money using their reserves as collateral. With the value of those reserves falling as commodity prices slide, they will be able to borrow less in the future, and may have to repay parts of some existing loans. Banks are now basing their lending decisions on a price of $48 per barrel of oil, according to a survey by Macquarie. The chief executive of Whiting Petroleum said earlier this month that the maximum amount of money it could borrow may drop from $4.5 billion to $3.75 billion as a result of the changes, according to the Bloomberg report. A recent In addition, banks regulators are paying closer attention to the sector. According to , big banks are facing pressure from Washington on their energy portfolios. Regulators from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp met with bankers in Houston earlier this month to discuss reserve-based lending requirements, according to the report. The result is tougher standards for loans, potentially higher prices for borrowers and a quick path to Chapter 11 for struggling companies that are pushed closer to defaults thanks to the plummeting price of their underlying assets.

Cosmetics retailers continue to dominate when it comes to good quality customer service. According to Which?'s annual survey of the UK's 100 biggest brands over a range of sectors, Lush scooped the top spot when it came to customer service for the second year in a row. The Body Shop, a company that didn't rank at all last year, swooped into the list in fourth place, just below retail bank First Direct and homeware company Lakeland, in second and third places respectively. The Body Shop was joined by John Lewis and its sister company Waitrose, which ranked in joint fourth place. For the first time this year, Which? also analysed the customer service of smaller brands in the UK. Topping the charts was beauty brand Liz Earle, recently acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance. Liz Earle was the only cosmetics company to make it into the top 11 brands. When it came to customer likes and dislikes, the survey found the one thing that consumers appreciate most in a retailer is friendly and helpful staff. Second to this is good knowledge of the product or service, and speed of service. Meanwhile, consumers had the most complaints about phone service, and particularly disliked call centres not based in the UK, automated telephone systems and being transferred to many different people.

Hamburg has formally submitted its bid to host the 2024 Olympics. The letter to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was signed by German Olympics sports organisation DOSB president Alfons Hoermann and Hamburg mayor Olaf Scholz. "This is a German candidature. We in Hamburg are carrying the torch but it is a festival for the whole of Germany," Scholz said. Hoermann said: "We are inviting the international sport family to get to know our clearly colourful and increasingly diverse country." Following the signing, the letter to the IOC was placed by German athletes spokesperson Claudio Bokel into a specially-installed letter box in Hamburg s port area after being carried by a relay of seven active and former athletes. "This is a moving moment. Especially now when we see how many people are coming to Germany, the Olympic Games are a signal in the right direction," Scholz said, referring to the country s efforts to house refugees. Hamburg s bid still has to go to a referendum in the city on November 29. At the same time residents of Kiel are voting in a referendum on holding the Olympic sailing events. Scholz said he was confident there would be "a large majority" in favour of the Olympics. The IOC will decide on the hosts in a vote in September 2017. The deadline for formal bid submission is September 15. Los Angeles, Paris, Rome and Budapest have also declared their intentions to bid.

Additional features of the new offering include: infrastructure-wide reach via Gigamon's GigaVUE-VM and GigaVUE nodes to feed RSA Security Analytics with pervasive traffic visibility; a NetFlow record generation that is unsampled; application session filtering, which eliminates unwanted traffic, such as streaming video from the examined traffic flows; and SSL decryption for faster threat analysis.

A man who voiced the cartoon character Charlie Brown in the 1960s has been charged with threatening a judge in California. Peter Robbins, now 59, also allegedly offered $50,000 ( 32,938) for the murder of Bill Gore, the Sheriff of San Diego County. The former child actor cried throughout the hearing. Robbins was due to be sentenced for lesser charges, as he had admitted violating his probation for a different offence when he drank alcohol and cut off his electronic tag. He has shown such a spectrum of emotions that I try not to pay attention. Bill Gore, the Sheriff of San Diego County Two years ago, he had pleaded guilty to harassing and threatening his ex-girlfriend 每 as well as the plastic surgeon who had enhanced her breasts. Given the new charges, his bail has been set at $250,000 ( 164,690). Robbins was nine years old when he lent his voice to A Charlie Brown Christmas in 1965, playing the world-weary, yet optimistic title character. He went on to appear in other animated Peanuts specials, as well as A Boy Named Charlie Brown. Robbins could face 11 years behind bars if he is convicted, and sentencing has been delayed.

Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton moved from being "inclined" to support the controversial Keystone XL pipeline to announcing Tuesday that she d oppose it. The move that comes as the former secretary of state seeks the Democratic presidential nomination and felt pressure from rival candidates as well as environmentalists and progressives. Here s how she got to Tuesday: October 2010: We re "inclined" to back it "We haven t finish all of the analysis," Clinton, then secretary of state, told the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. "So as I say, we ve not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so and we are for several reasons." June 2014: "I can t respond" but we re "trying to get it right" "I can t really comment at great length because I had responsibility for it and it s been passed on and it wouldn t be appropriate, but I hope that Canadians appreciate that the United States government -- the Obama administration -- is trying to get it right," Clinton told Canada s The Globe and Mail as she promoted her book, Hard Choices.
Miners have also been protesting, calling for operations to continue as they fear losing their jobs. Another nine residents of Halkidiki, northern Greece, who are part of a movement against local gold mines were released on Thursday after facing a magistrate in Polydoros. Their release followed that of 13 others on Wednesday. The 22 are accused of being involved in protests outside the town hall in Ierissos in March 2012 that turned violent and face charges including arson, possessing explosives, attempted bodily harm and causing damage. They deny all the charges. Of the 22, 10 have been ordered not to leave the country. A judicial council is to decide whether the 22 should be indicted.

At the stroke of midnight on August 5-6, international ports operator, Hutchinson Ports Holdings, sacked 40 percent of its workforce in one go. Workers at its Port Botany (Sydney) and Brisbane terminals were notified by email not to return to work (see Guardian August 19, 2015, 1698 ). Visit to picket: CPA national president Vinnie Molina, MUA Sydney secretary Paul McAleer, Guardian journalist Anna Pha and Sandra Berger. Workers weren't even allowed to pack up their personal belongings, instead being told the content of their lockers would be dumped in a box and couriered to their homes. And it didn't stop there; the then Minister for Employment Eric Abetz added fuel to the fire by endorsing the company's behaviour by saying it was "appropriate" for workers to be dismissed by text message or email. The Abbott government was anti-worker and the Turnbull government will be no different. Justice for the Hutchinson workers can only be won through struggle. Show your support for the Hutchinson workers by signing on the MUA website or if you can by visiting the community picket. www.mua.org.au Next article 每 First refugee baby born on Nauru Back to index page
Teenagers can be terrors, and battles are bound to break out. But not every argument has to be a free-for-all fight. It may seem fitting to make sure your little one knows who's boss in your home, but it's important to remember that your kids are still growing, and how you handle arguments with them will teach them how to handle arguments with others. You are a model for your son's behavior, and you're teaching your daughter what to expect from the world. So when frustrations rise and tensions boil over, remember this important advice about fights: 1. Words hurt, and cannot be taken back.

The New Orleans Saints have brought back veteran running back Tim Hightower and offensive lineman Mike McGlynn, two days after cutting both players while making roster changes for the season opener at Arizona on Sunday. Receiver Seantavius Jones and fullback Toben Opurum, who had been moved from the practice squad to the active roster, have been waived as part of Monday s moves to place the two veterans back on the roster. If Jones and Opurum clear waivers, they could wind up back on New Orleans practice squad. Hightower, a former Cardinals running back, has been trying to resurrect his career with New Orleans after missing three seasons because of complications from a serious knee injury. McGlynn is in his eighth pro season.
Adnan Januzaj enjoyed a strong full debut for Borussia Dortmund in their 2-1 win over Krasnodar in the Europa League. The young Belgian was kept on for the full 90 minutes by Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel who made all three of his substitutions elsewhere. Januzaj thrived in a free roaming No.9 role for Dortmund. He sent in 12 crosses, took two shots himself and also completed three take-ons. For somebody who was making his first appearance in the starting XI, Januzaj really looked the part and from Manchester United's perspective, it's a great start for his loan spell in Germany. Adnan Januzaj s game by numbers for Dortmund: 12 crosses 3 chances created 2 take ons 2 shots Constant threat. pic.twitter.com/NCUcLioYyD 〞 Squawka Football (@Squawka) September 17, 2015 The fact Tuchel was happy to keep Januzaj on for the full 90 minutes indicates he really did impress the Dortmund boss and that's what he's got to keep doing whilst out on loan. There have been plenty of sceptics who feel Januzaj's loan move to Dortmund was a mistake because it leaves Man United short of options if injuries force Louis van Gaal into making changes. That's certainly the case but a player like Januzaj at his age simply needs minutes, which is the opposite side of the coin. Either way, so long as Januzaj is enjoying himself out in Germany it can only be a good thing for his development. Date: September 17, 2015

European Space Agency/Pool/Anadolu Agency/ (NEW YORK) 〞 After catching up to the rubber duck-shaped comet 67P last year, the European Space Agency s Rosetta probe is now learning more about how the icy body was formed. The comet s unique shape is the result of two comets colliding at a low speed during the early Solar System, according to Rosetta scientists. The finding was reached after scientists analyzed high resolution images taken of the distinctly shaped comet and examined its layers of material. "You can imagine the layering a bit like an onion, except in this case we are considering two separate onions of differing size that have grown independently before fusing together," Matteo Massironi,a member of the OSIRIS imaging team from the University of Padova, Italy, said in a statement. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature . Rosetta s Philae lander made history on Nov. 12 when it landed on the speeding comet, marking the culmination of a 10-year, 4 billion-mile journey. After a bumpy landing, Philae later lost power before going into hibernation. Scientists heard from Philae again in June of this year when the comet lander woke up and began transmitting information back to Earth. Copyright 2015, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.
Pinoy Big Brother 737 Day 99 September 27 2015 The fifth season of the show premiered on February 9, 2015 after numerous teasers hinted that the show will return this year. This has been confirmed by Manzano, on his official Twitter account, for which he would return as host for the show s fifth season. Among the changes in the new season is that the briefcases have been reduced to 20 and instead of models holding the cases, it would be held by celebrities, dubbed as the "20 Lucky Stars". One celebrity would actually play the game as an actual contestant. This format of contestants as quasi-models had been used previously in several "box" versions of the franchise as well as the US syndicated version. Pinoy Tambayan | Tambayan Replay
MANHATTAN 〞 A Kansas City, Kan., man has been sentenced to nearly 52 years in prison for participating in a deadly attack on a Manhattan man. KMAN-AM reports that 35-year-old Anthony Nichols was sentenced Monday in Riley County District Court for attempted murder. He initially was charged with first-degree murder in the September 2013 death of 68-year-old John Burroughs. Nichols shot Burroughs after going to a rural Manhattan trailer park with a woman. Later, the woman returned with 34-year old James McKenith of Manhattan. McKenith is serving a life sentence for stabbing Burroughs. Riley County Attorney Barry Wilkerson described Nichols' extensive criminal history in seeking a long sentence. Nichols previously pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter in a Geary County killing that happened one day before Burroughs died.
Start the conversation Silver prices today (Thursday) saw a minor retreat as U.S. markets remained mostly flat throughout the day. At 2:10 p.m., silver prices today were down 0.05% and trading at $14.66. The precious metal is coming off an extremely volatile month, hitting a 2015 low of $14.11 on Aug. 26. Silver prices saw an overall loss of 1.4% in August. The volatility in silver prices last month was caused by historic sell-offs in stock markets around the world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average cratered 6.6% in August. The index saw the largest one-day plunge in its history on Aug. 24, which the media referred to as "Black Monday." China s Shanghai Index dropped 12.5% in August, marking its worst monthly performance in more than three years. The flat movement in silver prices continues to mirror the broader market. The Dow Jones saw a slight loss of 0.07% this afternoon. Today s quiescence can be attributed to China, whose markets are closed on Thursday and Friday this week. Many investors have been wondering why China s stock market is closed today. Some have even mistaken it as a strategy for calming the chaos that has plagued the second-largest economy since mid-June. That couldn t be further from the truth. Here s the real reason why China s markets are shut down during the last two days of the week＃ Follow us on Twitter at @AlexMcGuire92 and @moneymorning.

ARIZONA (AP) 〞 Welington Castillo, Paul Goldschmidt and Nick Ahmed homered for the Arizona Diamondbacks, who cruised to a 12-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night. Ahmed went 4 for 4 with three RBIs, including two doubles and two runs scored. The Diamondbacks won for the third time in four games, with four pitchers combining to hold the Dodgers to four hits. The last of the four hits was a grand slam by Justin Ruggiano in the top of the ninth inning with two outs. Castillo s towering drive far over the wall in left-center gave Arizona 3-0 lead, and Chris Owings triple drove in Phil Gosselin with the fourth run of the inning off Dodgers starter Alex Wood. Goldschmidt made it 6-0 with a two-run shot down the left-field line in the second inning. Wood (10-10) lasted 1 2-3 innings, allowing six earned runs and eight hits in his shortest outing since coming to the Dodgers in a trade on July 30. ( Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

MUMBAI The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Thursday it would not apply its strict rules on foreign exchange transactions for residents in India who are repatriating an asset held abroad as long as all underlying taxes or penalties have been paid under the Black Money Act. The RBI added no permission would be required either under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) when assets have been declared if they are repatriated within 180 days from the date of declaration. However, permission under FEMA rules would need to be sought if the assets will continue to be held abroad, the RBI said. India this year passed a tough rule against so-called "black money", or assets illegally held outside the country to avoid tax, vowing stiffer punishments while also providing a grace period with conditions for those willing to declare them.

"We have no candidate for the office of the Senate President, because we have a fit person occupying the position for now. We are behind him and we can't abandon him just because he is undergoing trial. Anybody can be put on trial, but the question we should ask is whether the trial is political or not. Does the trial have merit? When we see the merit of the case, we will take position. But for now, there is nothing like that."he told Punch. Follow @todaysgist Drop Your Facebook Comments Here!!
Dogs may be man s best friend, but horses are also helping veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Since June 2014, Mates4Mates has held seven one-week residential Equine Therapy programs around Australia. On Saturday in Brisbane, the organisation s senior psychologist Janice Johnstone told a PTSD forum the program s initial results showed increases in happiness and reductions in depression, anxiety and stress for the participants. One week doesn t seem a lot of time in somebody s life, she said. But one week on an intensive program where they have to engage every day, there s this animal, there are mates some who might have had the same experiences as them, is quite a significant thing for them. The program is the most popular of those run by the organisation, which provides support services to wounded, injured or ill, current and ex-serving ADF members. It s not about learning to ride a horse, but about building trust and understanding with the animal to feel alive, connected and motivated again . Program delivery manager Suzanne Desailly said horses had been successfully used as a therapeutic tool in other countries, including the US and Canada. The forum also heard about Whiskey s Wish, which provides fully qualified trained service dogs to veterans diagnosed with PTSD. AAP
A graduate of Abia State Polytechnic, Aba, waiting for the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, call up, has allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself with a rope in his family house. Vanguard gathered that the man whose name is yet to be ascertained at press time, allegedly killed himself on Sunday after attending a mass service in one of the Catholic churches in the area. A resident of Umuobe village, Ovom, Obingwa council area, where the incident took place, told Vanguard that the deceased had a good job, wondering why he had to take his life. "He returned from church on Sunday and nobody suspected that such a thing was going to happen. It was around 5pm that the bad news broke. The mother and the dad we learnt are all dead. 'I think he is the breadwinner of the family. It is very unfortunate. We learnt that he will be among the people that will be going for NYSC soon because he schooled in Abia poly," he said. A cross section of sympathizers who thronged the area, told Vanguard that the incident was a sacrilege which made it compulsory for a ritual to be performed before his body could be touched and buried. "So, it was on Monday that they (villagers) after performing the rituals took away his corpse from the room where it was lying," they said. When contacted, the Abia State Police Commissioner, CP Habila Joshak, confirmed the incident.
Kim Davis' lawyer actually said this : "Back in the 1930s, it began with the Jews, where they were evicted from public employment, then boycotted in their private employment, then stigmatized and that led to the gas chambers. This is the new persecution of Christians here in this country." Yes, because back in Nazi Germany, 83% of the German people were Jews, along with 90% of the lawmakers, and all of the highest leaders. The Holocaust then began when one Jewish person violated the law and went to jail because she was trying to force non-Jewish Germans to follow Jewish religious beliefs. You see, it started exactly the same way! Good analogy. Except for, well, everything. However, this is the new reality for many conservative Christians: in the vast majority, with virtual dominance over just about everything in the country, but if they are not allowed to force everyone else to do exactly what they say, well then, persecution and gas chambers for 83% of the country is up next. Because if Christians are not allowed the violate the law and deny other people their civil rights in the name of their religion, then how can this be called a "free" country? All snark aside, this is what they truly believe. For them, the norm is not equality for all, it is religious hegemony of Christianity over everyone else, and anything short of that is persecution of all their kind. I wish I were kidding.

R.I.P. Photo: Cheryl Gerber/Corbis Some sad news. The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports Willie Mae Seaton, owner (and namesake) of the beloved New Orleans restaurant Willie Mae s Scotch House, died this past Friday, September 18, at the age of 99. A former beautician who converted her beauty shop into a bar in 1957, which she later turned into a restaurant where she cooked food like smothered veal and fried catfish, Seaton became nationally lauded for her fried chicken. The restaurant was a neighborhood spot in the true sense of the word, and Seaton was willing to protect that at the cost of perhaps unwanted business: When the Times-Picayune wrote about it, she did not allow the address to be printed or for her photo to be taken. But that didn t 〞 couldn t 〞 stop people from tracking her down. She counted celebrity chefs John Besh and John Currence as well as the Southern Foodways Alliance s (SFA) John T. Edge and Treme writer Lolis Eric Elie among her fans, was named an America s Classic by the James Beard Foundation in 2005, and after floodwaters from Hurricane Katrina destroyed her business the SFA organized a rebuilding effort led by Currence. Eventually, she opened a second location in New Orleans s Uptown section that attracts long lines and a more touristy crowd. No doubt her many fans will be having a plate, or two, of fried chicken in her memory in the coming weeks. [Times-Picayune]

- WHAT: Faith-based leaders from across New Jersey will gather with state leaders including Lt. Governor Guadagno and DEA-NJ Special Agent-in-Charge Carl Kotowski, at Bethel AME Church, Morristown, to discuss solutions to the epidemic of opiate abuse. The Partnership for a Drug-Free New Jersey s (PDFNJ) Do No Harm Symposium will feature experts from the substance abuse prevention and treatment communities, among the scheduled speakers. WHEN: Wednesday, September 16, 2015 9:30 am to 1:30 pm Lt. Governor Guadagno will arrive at 1pm. WHERE: Bethel AME Church, 59 Spring Street, Morristown, NJ. The abuse of prescription drugs is a serious problem in New Jersey. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has classified prescription drug abuse as an epidemic. Many people, particularly teens, believe the misuse of prescription drugs is safer than abusing illicit drugs because they are prescribed by a healthcare professional and dispensed by a pharmacist. The abuse of these legal painkilling medications has triggered an increase in the abuse of the illegal versions of these substances, specifically heroin, by young people which costs less and delivers a stronger high. In New Jersey, law enforcement reports, heroin is easily accessible in all communities, urban, suburban, and rural and we re seeing a greater number of addictions to heroin as a result of addictions that stem from prescription painkillers.

Here it is, Friday again. This week was over before I even realized it d started! I hope you all had a wonderful week. My week began with feeding giraffes at the Colorado Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs, CO. I can t think of any cooler way to begin a week. It was so fun. Those tongues are long, though! Kind of freaky when they re reaching toward you, trying to get the lettuce. One kept licking my arm. The first draft of the short story for Suzi Weiland-Retzlaff is completed. I just need to make it pretty now, so I should make the deadline of Monday. Be on the look-out for the link! I lost about four days of the week to visiting my in-laws (which is why we were in Colorado), so I m finally getting back to editing, too. Last week s favorite photo was: Thanks a bunch to Suzi, Joe, Veronica, David and Lexa for your continued visits and comments. :) Here s this week s photos: Um, eew? We all have someone to fangirl over. I d say he did it. Puns! Boy 2 adores pugs and begged me to include this photo. My favorite is the cat making the dog smile, but I really like the puddle of evil, too. What s your favorite? Did you do anything unusual this past week?
CNN s Don Lemon took down a Trump supporter s comments that President Barack Obama is a Muslim with four words: "What does it matter?" "What if the president was a Muslim?" Lemon asked during a panel on his show Thursday night. "I mean, what does it matter? Aren't Muslims Americans as well? Don't we have the right to religion in this country?" Lemon was discussing comments that a New Hampshire man made to Donald Trump at a rally on Thursday. "We have a problem in this country. It s called Muslims. We know our current president is one," the man said. Trump, who has repeatedly claimed that Obama is a Muslim, responded in agreement. "Mr. Trump was referring to the need to protect Christians religious liberties as his previous statement says and nothing more," a rep for Trump told NBC.

Female agent manipulated scanning machine for male agent to pat down travelers he found attractive, according to employee who reported＃ Newly-released video shows the alleged groping by a former TSA screener that led to a scandal at Denver International Airport, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave. An airport security camera footage obtained by CBS Denver station KCNC captured the controversial pat-downs. Footage from the morning of Feb. 9 shows former TSA workers Ty Spicha, 27, patting down travelers the Colorado airport, while Yasmeen Shafi, 22, operated the scanner. According to one TSA employee who reported the pair, Shafi would manipulate the scanning machine to identify males Spicha found attractive as female. That would trigger the machine to detect an anomaly in the passenger s genital area and permit Spicha to perform a pat-down. Three months after that tip, the TSA began an investigation and eventually fired the pair. The Denver airport refused to release the video to CBS Denver for months, citing an ongoing criminal investigation. Shafi admitted to participating in the plot, saying it involved at least 10 passengers. The TSA called the incidents "shocking and egregious." The agency has not been able to confirm potential victims and no criminal charges have been filed against Shafi or Spicha. "CBS This Morning" reached out to＃

Story Tools: QR Favorite Social Media: Tweet September is National Kinship Month. During this month, Allen County Children Services celebrates the awesome work that Kinship Caregivers do for kids. These caregivers consist of immediate and extended family members, friends and other significant people who have strong bonds and connections with the children. They provide care for children when it is not safe or appropriate for them to remain in their homes. Kinship care providers keep children safe while maintaining secure connections to all which is familiar to them. Kinship Caregivers adjust their lives to ensure the well坼being of the kids. Sometimes they do so at great personal cost. They open their homes and give of themselves; their time and energy. These people choose to make a difference by caring, by rolling up their sleeves and becoming involved. They are a valuable part of a team, whose goal is the safety and well坼being of all children. On behalf of the staff of Allen County Children Services, it is with great appreciation that we celebrate Kinship Month 2015. To those caregivers we say, "Thank you! We applaud your extraordinary spirit and the generous investment you make in the lives of the children of Allen County". 〞 Anna M.

Pro-Palestinian group Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) is set to protest US singer Pharrell Williams concert in Cape Town on Monday night. BDS on Friday won a court decision which reversed the City of Cape Town s decision to restrict the number of protesters at the concert at the Grand West Casino. The court found that the restriction was unconstitutional and gave permission for 16 000 people to protest at the venue until 4pm. The City of Cape Town was ordered to pay all legal costs. Williams has been signed up by Woolworths to head up its Are You With Us? marketing campaign, which BDS South Africa claims is an attempt by the retailer to counter its boycott campaign. BDS South Africa has been boycotting Woolworths since the start of the Gaza War between Israel and Palestine more than a year ago for sourcing and selling products from Israel. The boycotts have included in-store protests. Woolworths has maintained that its products origins are clearly marked on the packaging and it is up to the consumer on whether or not to purchase the product. BDS says that it expects Pharrell WIlliams to face the "the largest protest any artist would have faced since the end of Apartheid".

Brent North Sea crude for October, the global benchmark, closed at US$47.58 a barrel in London, down US$1.94 from Tuesday s settlement.

Posted Wednesday, September 9th 2015 @ 11am by Michael Harthorne, Newser Staff ( NEWSER ) 每 Two brothers allegedly tried to kill their drugged parents and burn down their home near Atlanta Saturday morning, and neither their parents nor the police have any idea why, CNN reports. Police say Cameron Ervin, 17, and Christopher Ervin, 22, slipped their parents Xanax to make them sleepy before attacking them. Their father Zachary escaped to the garage and started hitting a car horn to try to get neighbors attention; his wife Yvonne ran upstairs to hide and call 911. Sgt. Rich Long tells CNN this probably saved their lives. The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports the 911 dispatcher could hear Yvonne listening to her sons coming up the stairs and one of them asking if she was on the phone before dragging her away; she was beaten, and her husband was beaten and stabbed.

A new ransomware variant for Android tricks users into installing a pornographic app then makes a picture of the user after which it shows a notification with the photo and the demand of a ransom to unlock the phone. The notifications shows the user's country, the IP address, internet provider and device specifications. To scare the user it also shows a warning stating the user committed a crime and has to pay a 'fine' of $500 to regain access to the phone. Victims can pay the $500 ransom to the cybercriminals using a Paypal My Cash Card. The ransomware also remains active after rebooting the phone and renders it useless. Making a photo of the victim is a method previously also found in Windows ransomware. It likely helps to convince the victim to pay the ransom. Before making the picture the ransomware checks the device for a front camera. When a front camera is found the malware makes a picture of the user when using the app. Although it's fairly easy to remove the ransomware by booting into safe mode and then removing the admin rights of the app, it's better to prevent getting these kind of apps. The app, called Adult Player, is not offered in the Google Play store and security analyst Shivang Desai of Zscaler Labs therefore recommends users to only install apps from trusted sources like the Google Play store.

Nagpur: The Maharashtra government allotted 289 acres of land to Anil Ambani's Reliance Aerostructure Ltd (RAL) here for its proposed aircraft and helicopter manufacturing unit Friday. It is going to be India's first private sector defence manufacturing project. The project is likely to be known as Dhirubhai Ambani Aerospace Park. As part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pet project 'Make in India', RAL will set up the 6,500 crore unit in Multimodal International Hub Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN) to manufacture military as well as civil aircraft. The unit will also collaborate with Russia to manufacture the Kamov 226T helicopters, besides aerospace platforms. Describing the project as a milestone for MIHAN and Vidarbha, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, "Anil Ambani has been praising MIHAN during his visits to Russia, France and has in a way served as its brand ambassador. This canvasing of MIHAN will help bring many global companies to MIHAN." Reminiscing about his association with Anil Ambani's father Dhirubhai Ambani, Union Surface Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said, "I had his blessings when I completed the Mumbai-Pune Expressway as he was initially very apprehensive of the project. For the this project, I told Anil Ambani that MIHAN is the perfect place and he readily agreed to be a part of the project. It will hugely trigger the development of MIHAN." 26/09/15 Vivek Deshpande/Indian Express

On a day with temperatures in the low 90s, a pop-up rain shower soaked fans already in the stands at Nissan Stadium before kickoff and a severe thunderstorm was nearby. Lightning also delayed No. 9 Georgia s 51-14 win over Louisiana-Monroe in the third quarter. When detected in the area again in the fourth quarter, officials called off that game with just under 10 minutes left. --- Online: AP College Football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org
OAKLEY -- The Contra Costa County Mosquito & Vector Control District will be conducting anti-mosquito fogging throughout the evening on Thursday, Sept. 17, according to a news release from the agency. Citing high numbers of mosquitoes in the area, and the detection of West Nile virus, district workers will be spraying the insecticide Pyrocide 7076 at a rate of .75 ounces per acre, according to the agency. The fogging will be conducted between 7:30 p.m. and 11 p.m., if the weather holds up. The area to be treated encompasses Main Street, between East Cypress Road and 4th Street. It is bordered on the north by Fetzer Lane and Monet Drive; on the east by Picasso Drive; on the south by West Cypress Road; and on the west by Jordan Lane, 4th Street, and Orchard Park Drive. Traces of West Nile have been discovered twice this year in East Contra Costa, thanks to a flock of "sentinel chickens" that the agency keeps in coops distributed around the county for the purpose of detecting West Nile. Chickens cannot get infected by the virus, so twice a week, vector control workers check their blood for West Nile antibodies. District officials say that there is often a correlation between dry weather and spikes in West Nile. Last year saw particularly high rates of infection among humans, but most of the reported cases were located in Southern California.

support wbur today CAMBRIDGE, Mass. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is apologizing for issuing an alert about an active shooter on campus last weekend. The university issued the alert Sunday afternoon following reports of gunfire at a Cambridge street festival near campus. The alert was quickly cancelled. MIT's executive vice president and treasurer Israel Ruiz on Tuesday apologized for the "confusion and distress" caused by the alert and blamed it on human error. He said it was caused by "accidental engagement of prescripted language we have prepared for a specific contingency: a time when we believe that someone is on our campus and shooting." He said at no time Sunday did anyone at MIT believe there was a danger on campus. A woman sustained non-life threatening injuries in Sunday's shooting. There have been no arrests.

Community Futures North Okanagan has developed a new initiative designed to support the manufacturing sector. The goal is to provide business and mentorship support to local manufacturers in order to increase efficiencies, stimulate innovation, improve profitability and enhance management skills. "The project will provide a forum where participants can freely discuss issues with like-minded individuals who understand the pressures and concerns of the industry," said Leigha Horsfield, with Community Futures. The program has been designed to help participants identify problems, see best practices, new technologies, to provide advice to help them become more competitive and innovative, and grow both the top and bottom lines of their companies. There is room for 12 non-competing companies who will participate at no cost for the first year. Participants will be the CEO or company representative who has overall responsibility for the operation. "This is an important aspect of the program. The decision-makers have to be the ones that take part in order to be able to move quickly or respond to changes," said Horsfield. Applications will be processed on a first come, first served basis. "We anticipate a big response from local manufacturers so we are recommending that interested businesses apply soon," said Horsfield. For more information, about the program, visit www.futuresbc.com.
Colombia will host the World Economic Forum on Latin America 2016 in Medellin, the second largest city in the country. The announcement was made Monday by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos while addressing the General Assembly of the World Tourism Organization in Medellin. While congratulating Medellin, once infamous for its levels of violence and as the base of operations for the world s largest drug cartel, on getting such a chance to play the host, Santos said the Colombian city is now a model of progress and innovation, fully worthy of receiving events of the world s highest level. "Colombia is leaving behind the image of violence it was so long identified with each day, we show better results in reducing crime and bringing tranquility to our country for Colombians and foreigners," stated Santos. No detailed schedule about the forum has been announced. This year s World Economic Forum on Latin America was held in Cancun, Mexico, from May 6-8.
PITTSBURGH 〞 Jordan Berry locked down the punting job with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Friday, beating out incumbent Brad Wing by default after Pittsburgh sent Wing to the New York Giants on Friday for a conditional seventh-round draft pick. A seemingly tight competition apparently turned into a bit of a blowout in the final days of training camp. Berry punted five times in Thursday night s preseason finale against Carolina while Wing had just one chance to convince the coaching staff to keep him around. Berry averaged a full yard better than Wing (49.8 to 48.8) and put six of his 19 kicks inside the opponent s 20. Wing s trade robbed one of the major position battles of any drama before rosters are set at 53 on Saturday, though Wing will be given a chance to stick around in New York. The two Australians developed an easy rapport while working side by side over the last six months, with Berry describing Wing as "a good bloke."

Friday evening, the kids and Elizabeth s friend from school went to the symphony with me. Matthew wasn t excited about going, but Brian worked late so he was forced to tag along. Eventually he came around, and we all had a pleasant evening out. The best part for me was meeting Elizabeth s friend. Lydia is very polite, gracious, and seems like a very sweet girl. She s smiley, happy, doesn t act like she s seventeen, and she takes school seriously. She reminds me of someone. Oh ya. Elizabeth. In a few days I m volunteering for the first time at her school by selling dance tickets during lunch. My motivation for volunteering isn t what it used to be; I signed up because I have a dental cleaning earlier that morning so already had the morning off. Plus, I thought this would be a fantastic chance to meet the rest of her school friends. I m glad Elizabeth has found her happy place. It was shaky with the academics at first, but she s found a good groove and is learning how to juggle better. Math is still a challenge, but she continues to try hard and it s been paying off. They weren t kidding when they said you really should give your child nine weeks to adjust. I m glad she and we stuck it out. She loves it there. It s a good fit. I m so thankful.

From my email: A woman walks into the downtown welfare office, trailed by 15 kids. WOW, the social worker exclaims, are they all yours?" Yep, they are all mine, the flustered momma sighs, having heard that question a thousand times before. She says, Sit down Leroy. All the children rush to find seats. Well, says the social worker, then you must be here to sign up. I ll need all your children s names. Well, to keep it simple, the boys are all named Leroy and the girls are all named Leighroy." In disbelief, the case worker says, Are you serious? They re ALL named Leroy? Their momma replied, Well, yes-it makes it easier. When it s time to get them out of bed and ready for school, I yell, Leroy! An when it s time for dinner, I just yell Leroy! An they all comes a runnin. An if I need to stop the kid who s running into the street, I just yell Leroy and all of them stop. It s the smartest idea I ever had, namin them all Leroy. The social worker thinks this over for a bit, then wrinkles her forehead and says tentatively, But what if you just want ONE kid to come, and not the whole bunch? Then I call them by their last names. 
A Long March-5 carrier rocket on Sunday was shipped from North China s Tianjin port for a rehearsal of a scheduled Chang e-5 lunar mission around 2017. It will be the first drill carried out in a launch site that involves both the carrier rocket and a probe, said the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. It did not locate the launch site. The Long March-5 carrier rocket was designed by China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. It is scheduled to make its first trial flight in 2016. With a payload capacity of 14 tonnes to geostationary transfer orbit, the largest carrying capacity in China, the rocket will greatly increase China s ability to enter space. China plans to launch its Chang e-5 lunar probe carried by the Long March-5 carrier rocket around 2017 to finish the last chapter in China s three-step (orbiting, landing and return) moon exploration program. Chang e-5 is expected to achieve several breakthroughs, including automatic sampling, ascending from the moon without a launch site and an unmanned docking 400,000 kilometers above the lunar surface.
STRICTLY Come Dancing's Arlene Philips braved traditional English weather to open a new retirement home in Tetbury. Last Tuesday, the ex-Sunday night show judge joined retirees on a guided tour of McCarthy and Stone's retirement living development Lewsey Court in London Road. After chatting with guests at a question and answer session she cut a ceremonial ribbon and unveiled a plaque to mark the occasion.

Arlene, 72, recently became an ambassador for McCarthy and Stone to launch The Colour Report 每 a campaign to breakdown negative stereotypes of the older generation.

If you've been longing for a new Android phone with a physical keyboard, BlackBerry's got what you need. BlackBerry has announced that it's working on an Android phone called the "BlackBerry Priv." The Priv will be BlackBerry's first Android phone, with a launch expected to take place in late 2015. BlackBerry hasn't spilled any of the Priv's spec details, but the company describes it as a "flagship slider device." So why go Android? BlackBerry CEO John Chen explains: "At the same time, we are focused on making faster progress to achieve profitability in our handset business. Today, I am confirming our plans to launch Priv, an Android device named after BlackBerry's heritage and core mission of protecting our customers' privacy. Priv combines the best of BlackBerry security and productivity with the expansive mobile application ecosystem available on the Android platform." It sounds like BlackBerry isn't happy with how its own BlackBerry 10 devices are improving its bottom line, so it decided to turn to Android to give its profitability a boost. Whether or not the Priv will do that remains to be seen, but Android is the biggest mobile OS in the world and Android phones that have a physical keyboard are basically non-existent, so there's a chance that the Priv could do well for BlackBerry. Will you buy a BlackBerry Priv?

"I lost friends both there and in World Trade Center. It was a tough thing, but we went to work the next day." Garlasco got underway aboard Gravely to study battle group interoperability during composite training unit exercise (COMPTUEX). "Being here was really fantastic," said Garlasco. "To see the way the crew came together and memorialized 9/11." The chief selectees and the first class petty officer association hosted the remembrance ceremony with a 9/11 slideshow, cake and ice cream for the crew. "We made announcements throughout the day over the 1MC marking different significant events that happened on 9/11," said Chief (Select) Quartermaster David Kopp. "Somebody told us that Mr. Garlasco was a survivor and we are very grateful he spoke for us tonight." The ceremony began with words from Garlasco and ended with a prayer from Chaplain Lt. J. Potter before cutting cake. USS Gravely is underway participating in COMPTUEX as part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group.

A man is in custody after the suspicious death of a 12-year-old girl at Aberglasslyn. The death of a 12-year-old girl at an Aberglasslyn home is believed to be "domestic" related, police say. The man in custody is the partner of the dead girl s mother. Forensic officers are investigating a crime scene at Redgum Drive, where the young girl was found dead about 5.45am on Wednesday. Police arrested a 31-year-old man at Racecourse Road, Rutherford, later that morning. He is assisting with inquiries. "The incident is believed to be domestic-related," a police statement on Wednesday morning said. Some nearby residents told the Mercury that they heard nothing out of the ordinary in the early hours of Wednesday morning. But one nearby resident said her usually quiet dogs began barking outside overnight. She said it was out of character for them to do so. Detectives have been door-knocking and interviewing neighbors this morning to help with their investigation. Police will make a further statement on Wednesday afternoon. Police urge anyone with information in relation to this incident to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or use the Crime Stoppers online reporting page: https://nsw.crimestoppers.com.au/.

Drew Peterson s murder-for-hire trial in southern Illinois has been postponed until early next year. The former suburban Chicago police officer is charged with soliciting an inmate to kill Will County State s Attorney James Glasgow, who prosecuted the 2012 case in which Peterson was sentenced to 38 years in prison for the bathtub drowning death of ex-wife Kathleen Savio. A Randolph County judge on Tuesday granted a request for more time by Peterson s court-appointed attorney. A trial set to begin in November is now scheduled to start Feb. 29. The ex-Bolingbrook sergeant is challenging wiretap evidence he says was improperly obtained, with a Will County judge first meeting with a jailhouse informant before considering the request to secretly record Peterson.

Having visited every country in the world, one man reveals the 12 countries he would recommend to other people above all others. At just 36-years-old, Norwegian Gunnar Garfors was the youngest person known to have visited every country in the world, The Independent reports. Although he embarked upon the epic trip as the result of losing a bet, he was lucky enough to not need to give up his job, and was able to work on-the-go using his laptop. Since returning home, lucky Gunnar has revealed the 12 countries he would recommend to other people. They are: Norway, New Zealand, Vietnam, Iceland, Romania, Uruguay, Madagascar, Nicaragua, Dominica, Kiribati, Sierra Leone and Kyrgyzstan. Gunnar completed his long journey in Cape Verde, just before his 37th birthday in 2013. In a poll on The Independent's website, of his top-12, the most readers have visited Norway and the fewest have visited Kyrgyzstan. Iceland is in fourth place; though Gunnar presents the countries in no particular order. Also read: Wold leaders opt to end poverty by 2030 Source: icelandreview.com

He was thrown feet first into the middle of a baying crowd and left to die ISIS have called gay people the worst of creatures Islamic State 18 September 2015 by Joe Morgan Horrific photos have been revealed of a murder of a gay man by ISIS in front of a baying crowd. Blindfolded and bound, the victim was taken to the top of a tall building. The man was then thrown feet first into the middle of the street and left to die. On each photo, the caption reads: 'The execution of the judgment of God on the acts of the people of Lot.' These pictures were posted on a JustPaste page by the Islamic State's province of the Euphrates, in reference to the river than runs through Syria and Iraq. While it is not clear where or when these pictures were taken, human rights activists believe they originate from either the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal or the Iraqi town of Al-Qa'im. Last month, the United Nations Security Council were urged to take action to support the victims of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Jessica Stern, executive director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, said LGBTIs need to be relocated and urged countries to provide refuge and assistance. ISIS have branded LGBTI people the 'worst of creatures' 每 something many Muslims have criticized saying these are extremists misinterpreting the Qu'ran.

Leave it to Hillary Clinton to offer up what some news organizations are trumpeting as an apology. "Even though it was allowed, I should have used two accounts. One for personal, one for work-related emails," she told ABC News. "That was a mistake. I'm sorry about that. I take responsibility." (This sounds like something I would have said back in my DEA days if $20 was disallowed on one of my travel vouchers.) http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/hillary-clinton-offers-first-apology-for-private-email-server/?intcmp=hpbt2 "Even though it was allowed..." No, Mrs Clinton. It was not allowed. They (the White House and State Dept.) just let you get away with it for 4 years. Meanwhile, over at Foggy Bottom, still reeling from the mess left behind by Mrs Clinton, John Kerry has appointed a"transparency coordinator" to ensure...... transparency. Only problem is the new transparency coordinator is a Hillary campaign contributor. Way to go, Kerry. http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/08/kerry-taps-state-dept-transparency-czar-to-oversee-records/

EL PASO, Texas -- Antonio Sanchez wanted to be a police officer. Turns out, police officers wanted Antonio Sanchez. The 36-year-old was arrested on a 17-year-old aggravated assault charge after he tried to join the El Paso Police Department last week. Sanchez was thought to have left El Paso after he and others were accused of assaulting a teenager at a party on May 29, 1998. The 19-year-old was unconscious and later died from injuries sustained during the beating. The background check likely would have caught the outstanding warrant, but Sanchez was actually busted before that, when an officer recognized him "and took note of his avoidance" during the physical agility test required by the police academy. Sanchez was released on $25,000 bond the same day as his arrest. He did not get the job.

09/05/15 05:30:00 Printable Page 09/05 17:24 CDT Hoffman takes the lead; Spieth misses another cut Hoffman takes the lead; Spieth misses another cut By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer NORTON, Mass. (AP) --- Jordan Spieth has missed the cut in consecutive events for the first time in his career. The Masters and U.S. Open champion reeled off three bogeys in a five-hole stretch on the back nine Saturday at the Deutsche Bank Championship. He didn t make a birdie until the final hole, but by then it was too late. He shot a 74 and missed the cut by three shots. Charley Hoffman had another low round at the TPC Boston with nine birdies for a 63. That gave him a three-shot lead over Brendon de Jonge. Even though he missed another cut, Spieth still could return to No. 1 in the world after this event.
Coleman told BBC radio host Nick Grimshaw on Friday that she would depart "Doctor Who" sometime during the upcoming ninth season, which starts to air in the U.K. today. She said: "I have left the Tardis. It's happened. I've filmed my last scenes." Coleman, who has been in the show since 2012, said: "There's not a lot of jobs where you get to go to work and have an alien as your best mate and get to run away from monsters ... it's been really special. I did get emotional." Eight-part drama miniseries "Victoria" follows Victoria's early life, from her ascension to the throne at the age of 18, through to her courtship and marriage to Prince Albert. Victoria went on to rule the U.K. for 63 years. Coleman told Grimshaw: "I need to learn to ride a horse, waltz, play Beethoven. It's really fun; it's like bootcamp." Victoria was "a vivid, strong, inspirational and utterly fascinating woman," Coleman said.

Advocate staff photo by BILL FEIG -- As LSU special teams coach Bradley Dale Peveto, left, watches, LSU head coach Les Miles has a word with linebacker Deion Jones (45) before Jones was ejected from the game Saturday. For two long days, LSU weakside linebacker Deion Jones couldn't bear to watch the play that resulted in his ejection late in Saturday's blowout of Auburn. Yet, Jones, LSU's leading tackler through two games, knew the error of his ways long before the Tigers gathered Monday afternoon to review the tape of their 45-21 thrashing. Jones, a senior who was making just his third collegiate start, knew as soon as he was flagged for targeting quarterback Jeremy Johnson the penalty carried an automatic suspension for the first half of the Tigers' next game on Saturday at Syracuse.
The Seattle Seahawks officially activated Kam Chancellor to the 53-man roster Saturday. The transaction was formality after coach Pete Carroll said Friday he expected the strong safety to start after missing the first two games of the season in a contract holdout. "He s looked like he s in just rare form," Carroll said, . "...So he looks like he s going to be able to play some football and we are looking forward to that." Carroll later acknowledged that "it is not unrealistic" that Chancellor plays all four quarters on Sunday versus the Chicago Bears. To make room on the roster the Seahawks waived safety Dion Bailey. It was a fast fall for the second-year pro. Bailey started Week 1 in Chancellor s place, but committed a glaring fourth-quarter error in coverage that led to a game-tying touchdown in Seattle s loss to the . Thirteen days later, the 23-year-old got cut. It s another reminder how quick the tides turn in the NFL. Bailey has practice squad eligibility if he passes through waivers.

A few years ago, Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) had no match in the online adverting marketplace. I still believe that this search giant continues to dominate this space, but over the last few years other technology companies have launched their bid to get a share of the cake. We also have noticed start-up companies come in the frame with unique ways of running online ads from email marketing campaigns to affiliate marketing and many more. Right now there are more than 200 companies in the ad-tech industry, including both private and publicly listed players, but only a few are well renowned. For a large part of the last couple of years, the battle has been on image/text (display)-based ads, but online video advertising also has been growing significantly with the likes of Facebook (FB) playing a major role along with industry veteran Google. In general, the ad-tech industry features different types of players in various sizes and market segments. For instance, Rocket Fuel (FUEL) is a programmatic marketing platform that utilizes big data in championing marketing campaigns with a view of increasing audience interaction and conversion rates. As such, the company s revenue streams significantly rely on the quality of traffic provided for its clients, though not necessarily by the number of conversions/clicks. Rocket Fuel went public in 2013 via an IPO, but since the beginning of 2014, the company s stock price has declined massively. Illustratively, FUEL stock price is down nearly 90% over the last two years. This decline has largely＃ Read More ＃

Dinamo Zagreb s 45-match unbeaten run came to an abrupt end, and head coach Zoran Mamic admits Bayern Munich were just too strong. Zoran Mamic conceded his Dinamo Zagreb side had no answer to the strength of Bayern Munich in Tuesday s Champions League encounter. Dinamo headed into the Group F contest on a 45-match unbeaten run stretching back to November last year, but were hammered 5-0 at the Allianz Arena. Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick to make it 10 goals in his past three outings, while Douglas Costa and Mario Gotze were also on target for the German champions. And Dinamo head coach Mamic was quick to praise the quality of Pep Guardiola s side. "Bayern showed how strong they are. They had a very good day and have been better than us in every aspect," he said. "The difference in quality is enormous, we have been really punished. "They have a lot of great players, who are very fast. It is difficult to foul them tactically. The result in the end is well-deserved." comments

OSAKA 每 Hitachi Ltd. and Kyoto University's iPS cell research institute said Monday they will launch a project to compare induced pluripotent stem cells generated from patients with diseases and from healthy volunteers, in an attempt to use the collected data for developing new drugs and elucidating disease mechanisms. The project, expected to start later this month, will utilize iPS cells to replicate symptoms of illness and genetic mutation outside patients' bodies. The Japanese company will collect blood cell samples during checkups at its health care center from roughly 100 employees and their family members who have consented to donating the samples and have a lower risk of contracting diseases. The Kyoto University's Center for iPS Cell Research and Application will store iPS cells derived from the blood cells, along with age, gender and other data. The center, which did not have enough iPS cell data on healthy people, reached the agreement with Hitachi to cooperate in soliciting cell donors. The iPS cell comparison project is expected to contribute to understanding the detailed causes of illnesses as well as the development of new therapies and pharmaceuticals.

As a few of you know Microsoft recently launched a client for Outlook Groups for Windows Phone simply called Groups. On the surface, it looks like your basic message app, which＃.it is, with a little twist. It's exclusively for groups created within and using Office 365 for business. This app is obviously in heavy development, icons are small and obviously not proportioned correctly with the screen and launching a calendar within the app simply takes you to your web browser. While the web browser version of mail and the calendar is very touch friendly, honestly it feels native to Windows Phone, viewing a calendar and mail is something we'd expect to see supported within the app. Indeed, it's a feature we expect to see in the near future. Also missing functionality includes the ability to create groups directly in the app. However, stuff that currently works includes integration with OneNote and OneDrive as you'd expect, which interestingly enough, ARE supported directly within the app. While this app for most of us could hardly be considered a must-have, for the right user, I'm sure this comes as a welcome addition to the Windows Phone Store.

Two Sun journalists have gone on trial accused of paying a Surrey police officer for information for stories. Prosecutors said the officer got about 10,000 over 10 years, and the "corrupt relationship" was based on "tip-offs" on incidents, arrests or celebrities. The Old Bailey heard the officer was "abusing the trust" placed in him. The journalists - Chris Pharo, 46, and Jamie Pyatt, 52 - both deny aiding and abetting the officer committing misconduct in public office. The trial is part of the Metropolitan Police s Operation Elveden, which is investigating alleged illegal payments to police and other public officials. Excellent contact Opening the prosecution, Julian Christopher QC said Mr Pyatt began paying the officer - who cannot be named for legal reasons - in 2002. He described the officer as "my senior Surrey police contact... an excellent contact", the court heard. The prosecutor continued: "This was not some technical breach of the rules＃ we don t expect our police officers to have two paymasters, to be carrying out their public duties with an eye to what they can make on the side by secretly tipping off the press, to be accessing the police computers looking for information which they can sell." The officer was allegedly paid in cash or by a Thomas Cook money transfer 18 times over a decade. Mr Pharo was the Sun s head of news and Mr Pyatt s boss between 2007 and 2001. Mr Pyatt was working as a district reporter when the offences were allegedly committed between 2002 and 2
Devon Sandoval scored twice, Javier Morales converted a penalty kick and Real Salt Lake beat the Los Angeles Galaxy 3-0 on Saturday night. Sandoval opened the scoring in the third minute with a left-footed shot from the left side of the 6-yard box to inside the far post, finishing Aaron Maund s headed pass. Sandoval capped the scoring in the 53rd, stretching up for a header from the middle of the box off Juan Manuel Martinez s cross. Morales converted from the spot in the 28th minute for RSL (10-11-8, 38 points), which kept its playoff hopes alive by moving within three points of the sixth-place Portland Timbers. The Galaxy (13-9-8, 47 points) remained tied with FC Dallas for second place in the Western Conference, one point behind the Vancouver Whitecaps.

BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for solidarity from other European countries to address the refugee crisis, after the number of asylum applicants reached 15,000 over the past two days. Merkel highlighted in statements regarding the measures taken to accommodate the refugees arriving in Germany, that "European solidarity" is the only way to face this "challenge". Merkel went on to say that Germany is open to welcome those who seek protection; however she mentioned that other European countries should also receive refugees according to "humanitarian standards". Merkel s statements came before the European Commission submits its proposal next Wednesday for the distribution of nearly 120,000 Middle Eastern immigrants who arrived in Hungary, Italy and Greece, among other EU countries according to a quota system. On Monday, French president Francois Hollande announced his country is willing to host 24,000 immigrants, while Spanish foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said that Spain is ready to give what it takes to host its share of refugees to help end this crisis. German vice-chancellor and federal minister of economic affairs, Sigmar Gabriel said that despite the expectation that Germany will receive at least 800,000 refugees this year, as well as its readiness to face this challenge in the long term, other European countries must provide support to curb this crisis. Chiefs of the German ruling coalition agreed in a meeting that ended early on Monday to allocate an additional sum of 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) to help the refugees, raising the amounts allocated in Germany for this purpose to 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion).
I've been doing some backend stuff to try to improve the peppiness of the website without having to take an ax to the number of posts and comments. Right now, we're running at nearly 100,000 comments and 7300 posts, plus, and whether you like it or not, that will tend to eat up system resources. So far I've optimized the sql database, and removed all the multiple revisions and iterations of each post. And I'm working on compressing images. You really don't need a 4mb image to go with a post. I've also made a point to block most traffic from other countries, as I've been getting indexed by search engines from Russia and China. I don't want to add a cache to the site, as that can cause problems, and sometimes gives hackers a way in. My host does a good job of keeping the trash out, but you can never be too diligent.

The National Labor Relations Board's recent decision expanding the definition of "employer" could have an impact upon relationships between construction contractors and firms providing temporary labor. Subcontractors could potentially fact similar issues. For example, Daniel Johns, a partner with Ballard Spahr, says may confuse the issue of which jobsite gate is the appropriate place for employees wishing to picket. In the current situation, workers who have a dispute with a subcontractor are relegated to a specific gate at the jobsite. That enables the owner and general contractor, who use a separate gate, to continue to work. "If some of those other firms are considered join employers, your reserved-gate system doesn't work," he said.
:46 AM EDT By The News Service of Florida The Florida Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to take up an appeal by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance about whether a major Jacksonville hospital needs to turn over information about contracts with health insurers, according to an online docket. Justices have not set a date for oral arguments in the case, which stems from a ruling by the 1st District Court of Appeal in favor of Shands Jacksonville Medical Center, now known as UF Health Jacksonville. The case centers on personal-injury protection auto-insurance claims. State Farm sought copies of contracts that could show the hospital agreeing to discounted reimbursement rates with health insurers, arguing the information was necessary to determine if amounts billed by the hospital for auto-insurance injury claims were reasonable. A circuit judge sided with State Farm, ordering the hospital to turn over contracts with 37 health insurers. But a three-judge panel of the appeals court overturned that decision, finding that it exceeded the "extent of discovery permissible" under parts of state law.
Copyright Metro Networks 2014. Posted Monday, September 14th 2015 @ 4pm by RichardLee@IHeartMedia.Com (Des Moines, IA) The U-S Department of Labor recognizes Iowa as one of the top four states for active growth in apprentice programs in recent years. Jason Shanks is in charge of apprenticeships at the Plumbers and Steamfitters Iowa Local 33 . He says they ve grown from 120-apprentices a few years ago to more than 280 currently. But, Shanks says he could use at least fifty more apprentices right now. And, Shanks says parents seem to be getting more on board with the advantages of apprenticeship training for their children. He says full benefits and salary while training with guaranteed employment and no student debt are some of the key selling points. Shanks says the program involves one-week in the classroom and six weeks on the job training for six cycles. He estimates their success rate at 96-percent in the construction trades apprenticeship program. Click here to find out more information on construction trades apprenticeship programs in Iowa.

Madalla a community in suleja local government area of Niger State is under the threat of erosion. City News gathered that erosion has degraded several parts of the town including areas around Madalla market, the road to the district head s palace, Monkey village, Rock Avenue, New site and Cold room road. Speaking on the threat of erosion, a resident in Madalla, Mr. Stanley Uchechukwu Uwalaka who is a final year student of Political Science in the University of Abuja, described the situation as "worrisome" saying that they find it difficult in the area during the rainy season. The district head Madalla community, Alhaji Musa Saidu Madalla, told City News that the community leaders have taken the matter to the local government but so far nothing has been done to control the erosion by the government. "We have gone this far with this matter; we have tabled our problems to the local government and the state times without number and sometimes some agencies from the state would come and assess the affected areas but nothing has been done to remedy the situation. "Unfortunately, if urgent attention is not given to the problem by the government, one day, this community will be washed away by erosion," he said. He noted that when it is time for campaigns, politicians will come and promise the people heaven and earth but when elections are over, they forsake the people.

:56 "Forests are an essential solution to climate change adaptation and mitigation," according to a statement released by the congress, which drew 4,000 delegates from government, conservation groups and the private sector to the South African city of Durban this week. Apart from offering oxygen, fuel and building material, trees store important quantities of carbon gas, which, if released, contribute to global warming. Members of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are due to meet in Paris from November 30 to December 11, bidding for a landmark agreement to curb carbon emissions. "Climate change poses a serious threat to the planet and to forests and forest-dependent people, and there is a risk that actions will fall short of what is required," the congress said. The Durban meeting also targeted the UN General Assembly summit in New York later this month on adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A UN report released at the congress on Monday noted that although some progress has been made in slowing the rate of forest destruction, an area of woodland the size of South Africa has been lost since 1990. The international conservation organisation WWF hailed the congress's declaration. "As we head into the UN climate change talks in Paris, all parties need to make sure the new climate deal creates incentives for the actions needed to reduce forest loss," it said. 2015 AFP
If you were excited about Nintendo s deal to put its characters in Universal theme parks, chew on this: the publisher behind games like Assassin s Creed, Just Dance and the Raving Rabbids games is building it s own amusement park. No kidding -- Ubisoft has partnered with RSG, a Malaysian park developer, to create a 100,000+ square foot indoor facility in Kuala Lumpur featuring Ubisoft-themed rides, attractions and shows. Believe it or not, this isn t as unprecedented as you might think. Last year Ubisoft partnered with a France s Parc du Futuroscope to create a Raving Rabbids ride, and Sega built a similar indoor theme park in Dubai . Don t expect a Disneyland for video games, though -- the proposed park s footprint is small enough to fit inside a Walmart, Target or Home Depot store. Can a theme park survive on the power of third-party video game franchises alone? We ll find out in 2020. [Image credit: AFP/]

HERMOSA, South Dakota 〞 Two workers are trapped after a trench they were digging for a sewer in western South Dakota collapsed. The Rapid City Journal (http://bit.ly/1QyOfZF ) reports the men are trapped up to their waists in the trench that is 12 feet deep and 10 feet wide. The men are conscious and talking, but authorities are concerned about crushing injuries that the workers may have suffered. The men weren t immediately identified. One man has said he s worried because he can t feel his lower extremities. Rapid City Fire Department spokesman Oliver White says the men were digging the trench in Hermosa when the embankment collapsed on them around noon Wednesday. White says the dirt at the site has to be moved by hand because the use of an excavator could cause a total collapse. Information from: Rapid City Journal, http://www.rapidcityjournal.com
THE Fiji Amateur Boxing Association has issued a stern warning to aspiring amateur boxers that participation in any event or promotion in Fiji that has not been sanctioned by FABA "will result in boxers being banned from all future Amateur Athletic Association (AIBA) boxing competitions locally. The FABA board issued the directive in a statement on Tuesday after confusion arose from certain segments of the boxing community with reference to the legibility of a particular athlete to participate in events whether registered or unregistered with FABA. Any athlete who participates in an unsanctioned event, whether professional, amateur or combined, will no longer be legible to represent the country in any international or regional event. Events with which amateur boxers normally participate in include the Pacific Games, Pacific Mini Games, Oceania Championships, Commonwealth Games, Commonwealth Youth Games, Olympic Games and Olympic Youth Games. The statement said with the federation tasked with developing and administering AIBA boxing in Fiji it was the duty to ensure that all rules and regulations associated with the sport are followed by all AIBA athletes, coaches and officials.
Opening statements are expected Wednesday in the corruption trial of former public health system executive Larry Slatky. Slatky, 65, of Cold Spring Harbor, previously pleaded not guilty to the two misdemeanor counts of official misconduct that he s facing. The charges stem from his time as executive vice president of operations for Nassau Health Care Corp., a $545 million public benefit corporation that includes Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow. Prosecutors contend that in 2010 Slatky ordered that a friend s company get a laundry contract for a publicly run Uniondale nursing home instead of the lowest bidder. They ve alleged Slatky negotiated a new lowest bid from the friend s company, even though that company wasn t the lowest original bidder among sealed bids. However, Slatky s lawyers say evidence is legally insufficient. They ve also said he finalized, but didn t award the contract, and that the contract ended up saving his employer money. Slatky resigned from his position at NuHealth before his 2014 indictment. The defense waived a right to a jury trial, and supervising Nassau County Judge Christopher Quinn will preside over the trial.
It has been reported that David De Gea made his first start of the season in Spain's Euro2016 qualifier against Macedonia on Tuesday night. The 24-year-old goalkeeper has been left on the bench by Manchester United as his summer transfer wrangling with Real Madrid carried on. De Gea kept a clean sheet as Spain defeated the Macedonians 1-0 in Skopje and is now looking ahead to United's Premier League clash with Liverpool this weekend. "I felt good out there. I really wanted to play the game," he told reporters. "Now I have to keep working hard and let's see if I have the same luck with my club." De Gea's Red Devils teammate Juan Mata was involved in the only goal of the contest with his cross bouncing off the bar and in off Macedonia keeper Tome Pacovski to keep the Spaniards on top of Group C having already qualified for next summer's tournament in France.

Carol Lambkin (left) and Cheryl Wise at the coffee morning TABLES groaned under the weight of home-made cakes when a coffee morning was held at Wyke Regis Memorial Hall, Weymouth, in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support. Organiser Carol Lambkin said she was delighted at how many people turned up to the event which formed part of a national day of coffee mornings for the cause. She added: "I used to hold this coffee morning in my home but it grew so big I have had to move to the Memorial hall. "It is a wonderful cause, the one charity I support. I have had so many people I know develop cancer and need Macmillan that it is an organisation which is dear to my heart."
study-well: The Pomodoro technique is a method of time management that eliminates the option of "burnout" by working in scheduled sessions and breaks. Here's how to use the technique: Choose a task that you'd like to get down. Set a timer to 25 minutes (this is the pomodoro). Work on the task until the timer rings. Once the timer has rung, put a mark on a piece of paper. Congrats, you've done a pomodoro! Take a short break. Get back to work for another pomodoro. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (e.g. 20 or 30 minutes). Here's an online timer to get started.
Stop what you re doing and start writing your Christmas list immediately, cos after you ve read about this new polaroid camera you re literally not going to want anything else in the world again. (Maybe a slight exaggeration - 5SOS m&g tickets would always be nice but you know what we mean.) So instagram might be great and getting loads of likes on facebook is nice, but there s something super special about an actual physical photo print - which is where old school camera brand Polaroid come in. Polaroid They announced their new camera, the Snap, earlier this week, and it s a thing of mastery. It s about the size of an iPhone 6, has a 10 megapixel digital camera and immediately prints 2-by-3 inch photos as soon as you take them. AGH. There s no screen, no ink (it uses Zink paper with is comprised of dye crystals that are activated by heat, just FYI) and basically means you can recreate Taylor Swift s full 1989 Polaroid collection from your very living room. UHmazing. What s more, is that there s *even* an SD card installed, so you can upload photos to your computer and upload them to facebook/twitter/instagram just as you would with normal photos. WHAT S NOT TO LOVE? Polaroid We need one immediately. Please. What do you lot make of that, then? Thoughts on all of this? They re available , and then let s discuss over on our twitter, or in the comment box below. THANKS. *** MORE LIKE THIS ***

As The Canadian population ages, we are seeing a growth in the country's dementia problem. In 2011, 747,000 Canadians were living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias - that's 14.9 per cent of Canadians 65 and older. Here are some stats that show how the dementia burden on Canadian society will begin to accelerate: By 2031: If nothing changes, 1.4 million people will have dementia in Canada - a 47 per cent increase from 2011 levels. Today, the combined direct (medical) and indirect (lost earnings) costs of dementia total $33 billion per year. By 2040: That's expected to climb to $293 billion a year, if Canada maintains its current path. In 2011, family caregivers spent in excess of 444 million unpaid hours looking after someone with cognitive impairment, including dementia. This figure represents $11 billion in lost income and 227,760 full-time equivalent employees in the workforce. By 2040: Family caregivers could spend 1.2 billion unpaid hours per year.
A Hotondo Homes franchisee has gone into liquidation and had its franchise agreement terminated. The collapse of the construction company has left six homes unfinished. The franchisee, Seachange Caloundra, owes about $850,000 and has 115 unsecured creditors. The business apparently turned over $2.7m in 2014 but had not prepared accounts for the last year, the liquidator told Smart Company . Glen Oldham of Oldham Liquidators said the cause of liquidation is likely to be poor financial advice. "We're looking at poor professional advice in the past, accounting and bookkeeping," he said. The CEO of Hotondo Homes, Caroline Kennedy, said the franchise had contacted affected customers directly. "All customers are protected by Home Warranty Insurance. We are working closely with the administrator to understand the potential impacts and assist where we can." 
One person suffered a minor injury from broken glass when a bullet cracked a windshield, Milstead said. The other bullets hit the sides of the vehicles and a headlight. "The best we know right now it s random," Milstead said, asking members of the public to call if they have information. Milstead said some of the motorists didn t immediately realize their cars had been shot, thinking the loud noise they heard was an object on the highway that struck their vehicle. "They stopped some distance down the road and when they got out they noticed there was damage to their vehicle," he said. Two shootings occurred about 11 a.m. Saturday, one about 10:15 p.m. Saturday and one about 4:25 a.m. Monday, he said.

LEWISTON 〞 The Lewiston Public Library and Auburn Public Library s Muslim Journeys film series will show "Islamic Art: Mirror of the Invisible World" at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 1., in Callahan Hall at the Lewiston Public Library. The 90-minute film will be followed by a short discussion led by Reza Jalali, the coordinator of multicultural student affairs at the University of Southern Maine. The film explores the richness of Islamic art in objects big and small, from great ornamented palaces and the play of light in monumental mosques to the exquisite beauty of ceramics, carved boxes, paintings and metal work. It revels in the use of color and finds commonalities in a shared artistic heritage with the West and East. Produced and directed by Robert Gardner and narrated by Susan Sarandon, the film also examines the unique ways in which Islamic art turns calligraphy and the written word into masterpieces and develops water into an expressive, useful art form. The event is free and open to the public. FMI: 207-513-3135, LPLReference@gmail.com .

ISLAMABAD: A Capital Development Authority committee verifying officers' degrees has served show-cause notices to three Pay and Accounts wing officers on Tuesday for not adhering to its directions regarding withholding the salaries of officers who have failed to submit their educational credentials. Of the total 1,149 grade 17 officers, some 1,030 managed to submit their educational credentials for verification to the relevant educational authorities by the September 10 deadline set by the authority. Earlier, a notification issued by the CDA chairman's secretariat directed the authority's pay and accounts group to attach salaries for the month of September for all employees who failed to submit their degrees to the verification committee. The committee has also forwarded a list of such officers to the accounts committee. "Why disciplinary proceedings should not be initiated against [pay and accounts wing officers] for not adhering to the committee's clear direction," says the show-cause notice. The CDA released monthly salaries earlier than usual 〞 September 17 〞 due to the Eidul Azha break. Meanwhile, members of the three-member verification committee said the degrees submitted by officers had been dispatched to the respective educational boards for verification.

pablographix/iStock/ThinkStock (WARSAW, Poland) -- The Russian ambassador to Poland says he meant no harm when he seemed to suggest that Poland was in part to blame for World War II, says the BBC . Amb. Sergey Andreyev was careful not to apologize or retract his remarks that caused controversy but did offer clarification. In a meeting of Russian and Polish officials, Andreyev argued that Poland held part of the responsibility for the start of the second World War by blocking the creation of a coalition against Germany, reports the BBC. Andreyev claims he was referring to the disaster in Poland and not the start of the war. Foreign relations between Poland and Russia have weakened significantly in recent years and Warsaw has strongly criticized Russia s actions in Ukraine. Copyright 2015, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.
Is China sending a military message to the U.S.? (CNN)Chinese Navy ships entered U.S. territorial waters off of Alaska last week, coming within 12 miles of the coastline, multiple defense officials told CNN Friday. The Chinese ships were doing operations "consistent with international law," U.S. officials told CNN, under the maritime rule of "innocent passage," where ships are permitted to enter territorial waters and are not challenged so long as they keep moving directly and expeditiously. U.S. officials emphasized that Russian warships exercise "innocent passage" around Alaska with regularity. However, this is a first for Chinese naval ships -- and the transit took place while President Barack Obama was in Alaska. U.S. Northern Command, whose area of responsibility includes all air, land and sea approaches to the continental U.S. and Alaska, told CNN it is not aware of any communications between the U.S. and Chinese military during the passage. When a CNN crew was aboard a U.S. P8 surveillance aircraft near manmade islands off the coast of China -- islands the U.S. does not recognize as Chinese territory -- the Chinese military warned the flight crew eight times to leave Chinese territory immediately. Asked about the difference, a defense official told CNN that as a matter of policy, the U.S. does not challenge ships executing safe transit through U.S. territorial waters, in part to be consistent with its history of challenging other nation s excessive territorial claims.

It needed to have the perfect petals; not too thick and leathery, yet not tissue-thin. The scent had to be powerful enough to be steam distilled. The plants must be bred under the natural constraints of the field, and then must make it through the next winter as well as be regrown from seed to test for staying power. It takes five years to know if the flower will produce enough oil and resist disease and pests. Kurkdjian and Ducher, whose main tool is a slender sable-tipped paintbrush to spread the pollen of one plant onto the stamen of another, have spent dozens of near-dawn mornings sniffing madly, eyes shut beatifically. 〞 Perfumer Francis Kurkdjian and rose breeder Fabien Ducher work to create a new perfume rose.

A Colorado coroner says there probably won t be many answers in the case of an 18-year-old man whose remains were found in the chimney of an abandoned cabin less than a mile from his home -- from which he disappeared seven years ago. The remains were found last month when contractors were tearing down the cabin, which had been abandoned for more than a decade. Workers found skeletal remains of Joshua Vernon Maddux, who was 18 when he was reported missing in May 2008. Teller County Coroner Al Born says the teen lived less than a mile from the abandoned cabin and was probably trying to shimmy down the chimney when he got stuck. Maddux hadn t been reported as a runaway. Born says it s unclear how long Maddux s remains had been in the chimney.
Police in the Czech Republic are investigating comments made on Facebook by an extremist politician calling for refugees to be placed in Terezin, the former Nazi concentration camp. Adam Bartos, the leader of the fringe yet vocal far-right nationalist National Democracy Party, published the comments on Sept. 7. Reacting to the establishment of a refugee camp near the country's border with Slovakia, Bartos wrote, "Why build tent camps for the aliens? We have the beautiful fortress town of Terezin where the aliens could concentrate before they are taken home by trains." Czech Jewish leaders have declined to comment on the incident. Terezin, known in German as Theresienstadt, is located 40 miles from Prague. About 144,000 Jews were sent there during the Holocaust, most of whom were later transported to extermination camps in occupied Poland. Some 33,000 died in the Terezin camp. 〞 jta

Abstract Although the international standard CityGML has five levels of detail (LODs), the vast majority of available models are the coarse ones (up to LOD2, i.e. block-shaped buildings with roofs). LOD3 and LOD4 models, which contain architectural details such as balconies, windows and rooms, rarely exist because, unlike coarser LODs, their construction requires several datasets that must be acquired with different technologies, and often extensive manual work is needed. In this article we investigate an alternative to obtaining CityGML LOD3 models: the automatic conversion from already existing architectural models (stored in the IFC format). Existing conversion algorithms mostly focus on the semantic mappings and convert all the geometries, which yields CityGML models having poor usability in practice (spatial analysis, for instance, is not possible). We present a conversion algorithm that accurately applies the correct semantics from IFC models and that constructs valid CityGML LOD3 buildings by performing a series of geometric operations in 3D. We have implemented our algorithm and we demonstrate its effectiveness with several real-world datasets. We also propose specific improvements to both standards to foster their integration in the future.

Advocate: PNG attempting to pre-empt supreme court case WELLINGTON, New Zealand (Radio New Zealand International, September 2, 2015) 每 The Papua New Guinea Immigration department has summarily removed the right of appeal from asylum seekers in the Australian run camp on Manus Island. At a meeting on Manus about 30 asylum seekers were told that they would no longer be able to appeal against negative refugee determination decisions. Until now, asylum seekers have been able to appeal negative determinations. But a PNG immigration official says the Minister for Immigration had decided people who got a negative result on the first interview would no longer be allowed an appeal. The Refugee Action Coalition says the asylum seekers were also told to either return to their home countries with the assistance of the International Organisation of Mirgration or be forcibly deported by PNG Immigration. A case is before the PNG Supreme Court that challenges the legality of the Manus camp and the Coalition s Ian Rintoul says PNG Immigration is trying to pre-empt the court s decisions and violate the rights of asylum seekers.

CHRIS BROWN GTS JOINT CUSTODY OF DAUGHTER by DatzHott on September 11, 2015 in Hott Culture Leave a comment Chris Brown has been granted joint custody of his daughter Royalty Brown: Brown and Nia Guzman squared off in a Houston court Friday morning. She not only wanted to deny Chris any custodial rights, she also only wanted to give him supervised visitation. The judge disagreed and we've learned Chris and Nia will share 50/50 physical custody, with Royalty going back and fourth every 4 days. Both Chris and Nia now live in L.A. And Chris, who was in court represented by Mark Geragos, scored another victory. The judge ordered him to pay Nia $2,500 a month in child support, which is exactly what he's been paying her. She wanted $15k. The judge also ordered Nia not to talk crap on Chris and not reveal anything about the case on social media.(Source) The post CHRIS BROWN GTS JOINT CUSTODY OF DAUGHTER appeared first on Black Celebrity Kids.

The Queen has thanked the nation for its kind messages on the day she becomes the longest reigning monarch in British history. Reflecting on the landmark record, the Queen admitted it was not a milestone she had ever aspired to. As she opened the 294 million Scottish Borders Railway in Tweedbank, the Queen said: "Prince Philip and I are very grateful for the warmth of your welcome on this occasion. "Many ,including you First Minister, have also kindly noted another significance attaching to today although it is not one to which I have ever aspired. "Inevitably a long life can pass by many milestones. My own is no exception. But I thank you all and the many others at home and overseas for your touching messages of great kindness." The 89-year-old monarch, with the Duke of Edinburgh at her side, has spent the day travelling 40 miles on the railway with Scotland s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, starting at Edinburgh s Waverley Station, stopping off at Newtongrange in Midlothian before carrying on to the Borders town of Tweedbank. Later today, the Queen overtakes the record set by her great-great grandmother Queen Victoria to become the nation s longest reigning sovereign, when she will have been on the throne for 23,226 days, 16 hours and approximately 30 minutes.

Hyderabad: Promoting mixed land use in area-based developments, planning for un-planned areas, expanding housing opportunities, creditworthiness and transparent financial management is the key as problems associated with urbanisation emanates from poor management of finances, Union urban development minister M. Venkaiah Naidu said. "Focus should be on enhancing the resource base through imposition of betterment tax, impact fee and advertisement tax. Optimisation of network of own tax and user charges without losing sight of the mandate of social recovery is needed. Cities that perform better will receive more funds." The Centre on September 7 had sanctioned Rs 2 crore per state to prepare a detailed project report on smart cities. The selected states and Union Territories account for 40 of the 100 Smart City mission participants, 158 of the Amrut cities (33 per cent) and five of the 12 Hriday cities (42 per cent). The population of the 40 Smart City nominees is over 5.50 crore which is 42 per cent of the 13 crore urban population in 98 cities included in the mission so far.

Abstract Background A programme director is often required to organise postgraduate medical education. This leadership role can include educational as well as managerial duties. Only a few published studies have explored programme directors' own perceptions of their role. There is a need to explore the use of theoretical frameworks to improve the understanding of educational roles. Objective To explore programme directors' own perceptions of their role in terms of tasks and functions, and to relate these roles to the theoretical framework developed by Bolman and Deal. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 programme directors between February and August 2013. The data were subjected to content analysis using a deductive approach. Results The various roles and tasks included by participants in their perceptions of their work could be categorised within the framework of functions described by Bolman and Deal. These included: structuring the education (structural function); supporting individuals and handling relations (human resource function); negotiating between different interests (political function); and influencing the culture at the departmental level (symbolic function). The functions most often emphasised by participants were the structural and human resource functions. Some tasks involved several functions which varied over time. Conclusions Programme directors' own perceptions of their roles, tasks and functions varied widely. The theoretical framework of Bolman and Deal might be helpful when explaining and developing these roles.

LONDON -- The World Health Organization says a child has been paralyzed by polio which was detected in Mali. It is the first case of polio in Mali since 2011 and WHO says the 19-month-old child was stricken in Guinea before arriving in Bamako. In a statement issued this week, WHO said the polio strain responsible for the new outbreak is derived from the vaccine. In very rare cases, the live polio virus can mutate into a form capable of sparking new cases. WHO said the risk of polio spreading further is "deemed high" and blamed the outbreak on low vaccination rates in Guinea, which is still battling Ebola. Last week, WHO announced a similar polio outbreak in Ukraine, also caused by a mutated strain from the vaccine.
Hi everyone was just looking for more advice please. As said previously my husband had a Turb carried out in June. Ever since he has been back to gp on countless occasions and back in hospital with stinging pain while urinating and severe pain round right hand side. Specimens keep coming back with no infection but blood and white cells present. No infection. He has had numerous antibiotics, painkillers and spasm tablets. Surely this is not normal? He is convinced the tumour is back as the same symptoms are back including intermittent blood in urine. Can the tumour grow back this quickly? He is not due to have follow up cystoscopy until end of October. Gp not sure what this is but says he will probably not get an earlier appt with consultant than the one he has. Has anyone else had a similar experience? 
KLAMATH FALLS 〞 The Klamath County Sheriff's Office has been temporarily removed from homicide investigations because of the ongoing criminal and civil proceedings involving Sheriff Frank Skrah. The Herald and News reported that District Attorney Rob Patridge said the decision has been made to ensure homicide investigations would not be affected by issues surrounding the sheriff's office. The removal will ensure the allegations against Skrah don't hinder the county's ability to prosecute homicide suspects, he said. The sheriff's office normally contributes two detectives and a supervisor in an investigation. According to a memo sent Monday, the Oregon State Police will now take over the homicide investigations. Skrah was indicted Friday following allegations he used excessive force against inmates. He faces nine misdemeanor charges.

I have published several posts about the ship Titanic and coincidences. Here s a further coincidence story that has connections with the Titanic and it s one I haven t mentioned previously. There was a young seaman called William Reeves. He was on watch in the bow of a steamer heading to Canada from Tyneside in north-west England. The year was 1935. The month was April - the same month of Titanic s sinking. Reeves became obsessed with thinking about Titanic s downfall. He felt some strong negative feelings about his voyage. The thoughts of danger took shape in the seaman s mind as he remained on watch. He strained his eyes looking for any signs, but could see nothing but the gloom and darkness. He felt though that something was wrong, but couldn t say why. He felt too scared to shout out any alarm for fear of ridicule. His feelings of doom, however, became stronger when he realized the date was April 14, the same day the Titanic sank. He risked making a fool of himself and shouted out a danger warning, The helmsman immediately rang the signal: engines full astern. The ship churned to a halt ... just yards from a huge iceberg which towered high out of the water. There were also other icebergs crowded round the steamer. It took nine days before the Newfoundland icebreakers could smash a clear path for the steamer. By another strange coincidence the steamer was called the Titanian.

Legislative analysts say New Mexico's economy shows some signs of recovery but continues to struggle compared with those of neighboring states and the country as a whole. SANTA FE The Legislative Council Service also said Monday that "a lot has to go right" for a recent forecast projecting modest revenue growth for the next five years to hold. That forecast called for $293 million of additional revenue in the next fiscal year, but the service said factors determining whether the forecast stands up over time include oil prices and China's economy. The service said the recovery from the Great Recession continues in slowly and unevenly, taking nine years to approach employment levels last seen in 2006. That's a slower recovery than those of the rest of the country and neighboring states.
WASHINGTON 每 The Justice Department is providing new guidance designed to encourage federal prosecutors to bring criminal cases against corporate executives. Under policies issued Wednesday, corporations will be required to turn over evidence against individuals if they want credit for co-operation. The department is also directing its civil and criminal lawyers to work together in all corporate matters, and says corporate investigations will begin with a focus on individuals. Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates is expected to discuss the changes in a speech in New York on Thursday. The department in the last year and a half has reached multi-billion-dollar civil settlements against several banks and brought criminal charges against others. But it has faced criticism that it has not prosecuted enough Wall Street executives, including after the financial crisis.

Home | News A non-league player has become the first to be charged by the Football Association under a new law designed to clamp down on simulation. Welling s Sahr Kabba was charged for "allegedly exaggerating or feigning an injury which directly led to an opponent being dismissed", the governing body said in a statement. The incident happened during Welling s 1-1 draw at home to Tranmere on Saturday when Kabba went down following what the officials believed to be an elbow from Ritchie Sutton, who was sent off. Sutton s three-match ban was overturned on appeal, though, after the club submitted video and written evidence to the FA to prove the decision had been incorrect. Kabba has now been charged for his actions and has until 6pm to respond. The FA introduced its new policy before the start of the season to "address on-field behaviour in English football".

In the 80 s, Anheuser-Busch invited consumers to "head for the mountains" with Busch Beer. If you were unfamiliar with what was the brewery giant s 3rd brand, behind Budweiser & Michelob, you re forgiven, since Busch had actually been around for over 25 years. Introduced as Busch Bavarian Lager in 1955, the brewers shortened the name to Busch Beer in 1979. To help with the relaunch, Anheuser-Busch contracted Hanna-Barbera to produce a promotional short starring Fred Flintstone & Barney Rubble from The Flintstones. However, this cartoon was produced in 1967, a year after the series ended. What do you think?

The most recent short interest data has been released by the NASDAQ for the 09/15/2015 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

HUNDREDS of runners raised 10,000 in an unusual race 每 which took them through a hangar at the RAF Museum in Colindale to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain at the airfield the RAF crews departed from. The race on Sunday (Sept 6) started in the shadow of a Spitfire and took the runners through The Bomber Hall at the museum in Grahame Park Way, around an Avro Lancaster Bomber, the craft which were used in bombing raids over Germany, including the Dambusters raid of 1943. Many of the runners were in period dress from the v1940s and one athlete even sported a home made model cardboard Spitfire. They then headed off for two loops of a flat road course in the 10k event. The 600 runners raised 10,000 to support the Historic Hendon Appeal which will tell the story of the museum's former life as an airfield in wartime. Spitfires departed for the Battle of Britain from the airfield and Winston Churchill first learnt to fly there.

After kicking off the oEmbed feature plugin a couple of weeks ago, it's high time for another status update. In case you have missed it, the oEmbed API plugin makes WordPress an oEmbed provider, allowing you to embed blog posts just like YouTube videos or tweets. Of course everything happens with security and ease-of-use in mind. Embedding a post is super simple! We made some great progress over the last few weeks. The highlights are: Improved test coverage, which led to many fixed bugs Auto-resizing of the embedded iframe so it looks great on every screen It seamlessly integrates with the REST API, but also works perfectly without it The plugin is very stable so far. We're looking into bringing it to WordPress.com for testing, but of course we also need your help to bring this further! Download the plugin from the repository 〞 play with it, break it, and help us fixing all bugs that may appear. We're always looking for areas to improve. We're now mainly working on getting it into shape for an eventual core merge proposal and implementing the different oEmbed response types. This means supporting embedding attachment posts and posts with different post formats. Please, test and report both errors and suggestions either on GitHub or our feature-oembed Slack channel. Anyone is welcome to join us! Next chat: September 7 2015 9pm UTC
A change in WordPress that just landed in trunk is to move the comment textarea to the top for logged-out users when replying. This is done largely with the goal to improve keyboard/focus navigation, but also aims to make it easier for end users to leave comments on WordPress sites. The change necessitated some filters and actions now being run in a different order. It also means that the HTML output by comment_form will now be different. This is what the comment form looked like before This is what the comment form looks like after. If you use any of the hooks inside comment_form , but especially comment_form_field_comment and comment_form_after_fields , you are highly encouraged to test your code against the current WordPress nightly and report any issues on ticket 29974 so that any necessary adjustments can be made. Visual records and example code will help ensure everyone is satisfied with the final result.
Spa Creators is working on a spa and leisure development in the Tadawul Tower, future home of the Saudi Stock Exchange, due to open in late 2016. The 750sq m (8,073sq ft) spa is designed for the exclusive use of the occupants of the building, and will include separate men's and women's spas. The men's spa will include a vitality pool, steam room, sauna, experience showers, several treatment rooms and a large fitness centre. The women's spa includes similar facilities, but is about a third of the size. Suppliers have not yet been decided, said Alistair Johnson, managing director of Spa Creators, as they are still working through the design phase. This is the first Middle Eastern project for the UK-based spa designer and developer. "Spa Creators have been developing a strong reputation for spa and leisure design and development in the UK, and this is now being recognised internationally," said Johnson. "With the use of modern technology, the world is becoming smaller, and our company is extending its services and looking to grow the international markets." Owned by Riyadh Investment Company, the 41-storey Tadawul Tower is designed by Tokyo-based Nikken Sekkei architects, and won the International Property Award 2013 for the Best International High-rise Architecture.

New Delhi :Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Somnath Bharti got relief in the domestic violence case filed against him by wife Lipika when the Delhi High Court stayed his arrest till Thursday. The former Delhi law minister had moved High Court after a city court on Monday cancelled his bail plea and issued an arrest warrant against him. AAP, meanwhile, asked Bharti to surrender before police. Sources said the party was upset with Bharti as it is unable to contact him. "We are trying to contact him, but are not able to. We advise him to surrender before police," said AAP leader Ashutosh. Party sources, meanwhile, said that Bharti's "remaining incommunicado" was sending a wrong signal as AAP has been maintaining the stand that Delhi Police have been victimising its MLAs by arresting them. Three AAP MLAs 每 former law minister Jitendra Singh Tomar, Manoj Kumar and Surinder Singh 每 have faced arrest by Delhi Police. Delhi Police registered an FIR against Somnath Bharti, three months after his wife Lipika Mitra filed a case of domestic violence against him, levelling serious charges including that of "unleashing" dogs on her when she was pregnant.

SOURCE Canadian Securities Administrators TORONTO The Rule Amendments follow a "comply or explain" model and require all non-venture issuers to make certain annual disclosures with respect to women on boards and in executive officer positions. "These disclosure requirements were adopted to increase transparency and to provide meaningful additional information that investors can consider when making investment and voting decisions. While we found that some issuers have carefully considered the new disclosure requirements, we strongly encourage all issuers to review the guidance in the notice published today to improve the quality of disclosure and increase transparency regarding the representation of women on boards and in executive officer positions," said Louis Morisset The results of the review revealed that among the issuer sample, 49% have at least one woman on their board, 60% have at least one woman in an executive officer position and 15% have added one or more women to their board this year. The review also found that issuer size and industry were the most significant indicators of whether issuers had adopted initiatives to increase the representation of women on their board or in executive officer positions.

MASSILLON, Ohio 〞 Ohio says the tiger cub being used to continue a high school football team s live-mascot tradition this season stays at an out-of-state facility, meaning it doesn t quite fit under the exemption created for it when the state tightened rules on possession of dangerous animals. The exemption was meant to let Massillon Washington High School and its boosters have a tiger under certain restrictions. A spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Agriculture says the caged cub displayed at the season opener came from and returned to an out-of-state facility licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She wouldn t identify the facility Wednesday. She says the facility indicated the arrangement with Massillon boosters would continue through the season, so officials are discussing and evaluating it to ensure it meets legal restrictions.

Sep 8, MOJNEWS - Financial sanctions against Iran may be lifted by 2016, according to four aware diplomats quoted by Bloomberg. According to a report by Bloomberg, four diplomats has said that oil and financial sanctions against Iran are supposed to be lifted in the first 3 months of the year 2016. According to the nuclear deal signed between Iran and P 5+1, international sanctions against the country are to be lifted and in return for some restrictions on the nuclear activities of the country. 3 of the diplomats have asserted that the monitoring processes will start in January or February, and one said that monitoring is to be continued to March next year. Yukiya Amano, IAEA Director General, said during a press conference: "We'll do everything to accelerate our work but it depends very much on Iran's activities and they are related to technical realities ＃ We need to see how they can organize and how fast they can do it." This is while, he confirmed that Iran is willing to implement the agreement requirements "as soon as possible". Iran has the world's fourth largest oil reserves and the region's second largest petrochemical sector which aims to return to the world's markets after the nuclear agreement.
President Obama has reached the point when a president s thoughts turn to how he will spend his time after he leaves office, and he has reportedly suggested that one item on his agenda will be making the federal government more effective. This is an ironic twist for someone who promised some 6 1/2 years ago to restore faith in our government and make it "cool again." After all this time as the nation s chief executive, he plans to make the government better after leaving office?

The Late Aylan Kurdi from Syria found on a beach in Turkey (C) 2015 Ed C Lunnon / 9 years ill ... / Advantage CBD Seventy years have passed since the end of World War II in 1945. The world has been celebrating this event over the last few weeks. When we see pictures from that War we are stirred to say "Never Again" would we allow this to happen. And yet, right now, as I am writing, I am seeing images flash across my TV screen which are as horrific as and reminiscent of those WW II images. Trains and truckloads of people being transported ... Displaced by destruction, weary from war, searching for safety and security and fighting for food! It is the biggest migration of people since World War II - over sea and over land. And we appear to be allowing it to happen all over again! Where is the world in Syria? It s not an easy solution to a difficult problem and Europe appears to be fighting itself with answers. I placed a question on FB today ... What would you do if truckloads and trainloads and boatloads of migrants arrived on your doorsteps? That in itself has created a healthy debate! So, as I fight CBD today, my war against my enemy, I repeat the question to you: What would you do should Aylan have arrived on your doorstep before he drowned in the Mediterranean Sea?
, in Bicske, near Budapest, Hungary. (Photo: Matt Cardy, ) Leaders in Austria and Germany have agreed to take in migrants from troubled Hungary who approach their border, the Austrian chancellor said. In a statement posted to Facebook, Werner Faymann said that the agreement had been reached after communication with Austrian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, "due to today s plight at the Hungarian border." Earlier Friday, hundreds of frustrated migrants left Budapest on foot and began walking toward the Austrian and German borders, their numbers stopping traffic on highways, Hungary Today reported. At a railway station in Bicske, about 20 miles west of Budapest, groups of migrants refused to be transported to a reception center, the news organization reported. The migrants were passengers on a train that was stopped at Bicske, but said they preferred to go to Germany rather than a refugee camp, according to Hungary Today . The announcement from Faymann came after a day of increased tensions among refugees attempting to leave Hungary. "Hundreds of refugees are currently on foot from Hungary to Austria," read a statement released by the Austrian interior ministry translated into English. "Police and Red Cross are prepared for the arrival of refugees. Every refugee in Austria can apply for asylum." The statement further read, "A solution of the current situation can only be ensured in the spirit of European solidarity." Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1UxRRfu
Russia s second-largest passenger airline, the struggling Transaero, will be taken over by the country s top carrier, Aeroflot. Transaero said Tuesday in a statement that its "consolidation ... into the Aeroflot group" has been approved by a government commission headed by Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov. The commission found a takeover would be "in the interests of the further development of civil aviation and the creation of one of the largest air-transport groups in the world," Transaero said. Financial terms were not disclosed. Transaero has been struggling with debt at a time when Russia s economic problems have buffeted the airline industry. The company had debts of 67.5 billion rubles ($1 billion) as of June 30, according to its report for the first half of the year. State-controlled Aeroflot told Russia s Interfax news agency that "Transaero s activities will be restructured and integrated at the operational level." Transaero and Aeroflot compete on many domestic and international routes, meaning that a takeover may lead to significant duplication. Aeroflot led Russian airlines by transporting 14.6 million passengers on domestic and international routes in the first seven months of the year, compared to 7.5 million for Transaero, according to Russia s Federal Air Transport Agency. The next biggest airline, S7, transported 4.5 million passengers.

If you re trying to get your child to eat healthier, start with this popular＃ American kids don t eat enough fruits and vegetables, but doctors say knowing what they ll like might be half the battle. "You want to think about what kids like so then you can offer that to kids from an early age," Dr. Deena Blanchard of NYU Langone Medical Center told CBS News. "The other thing is that we know kids are more likely to try new foods if they try it with something they like." The most popular choice: apples. A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics says apples account for about 19 percent of all fruit eaten by children and teens between the ages of two and 19 years old. The study is based on data from more than 3,100 kids from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2011 and 2012. The study also found about a third of children s fruit consumption came in the form of 100-percent juice drinks. But doctors say juice alone doesn t have the same health benefits as eating whole fruits. Drinking juice has also been shown to contribute to weight gain . "You are not getting the fiber that you are getting with eating a whole piece of fruit," Blanchard said. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against giving juice to infants; for toddlers it recommends primarily drinking water or milk, and limiting fruit juice to no more than 4 to 6 ounces a day. The advice makes sense to mom Danielle Kilarjian. She says apples are a favorite＃
It s one thing to be without Dez Bryant for an extended period, but the Cowboys playoff perspective suddenly changed in the time it took quarterback Tony Romo to absorb the full impact of Eagles linebacker Jordan Hicks on Sunday afternoon. Romo has a fractured left clavicle, the team announced late in Sunday s game against theEagles. With the Cowboys leading 13-0 with 9:44 to go in the third quarter, Romo fumbled while going to the ground, a situation made decidedly worse when the 236-pound Hicks punctuated the play by driving Romo into the turf. Romo, who injured his left shoulder, was down on the field for several minutes before making his way to the locker room. Shortly after Romo left the field, FOX Sports sideline reporter Erin Andrews provided this update: "We had a shot of Tony coming off the field and if you can read lips, it s broken. I was just waiting by the X-ray room and Tony just emerged, equipment off, holding his left arm to his chest, head was down." In 2010, Romo broke his left collarbone in 2010 and missed 10 games. That season, Jon Kitna started nine games in his place and Stephen McGee started another. The 6-10 that season. Also read: Bad start, bad timing for Keuchel Source: cbssports.com

- Filed Under Inside News , News | Leave a Comment MANGALDAN〞Sixty-five dengue cases and average of three to five sore eyes cases were recorded daily by the municipal health office (MHO). Ofelia Rivera, municipal health officer, said the dengue cases increased from 63 for the whole year of 2014 to 65 from January to August this year. "We are addressing this through our misting operations and free consultation daily", said Rivera. One suspected death from dengue was reported but Rivera said the case is still being verified. Meanwhile, the MHO has been alarmed by the increasing number of sore eyes cases in the town as well. "There were no cases of sore eyes last year but this year starting July, there are three to five cases visiting our facility daily", said Rivera. She clarified sore eyes could also be prevalent during cold season and not only during summer. Meanwhile, Rivera busted myths on curing sore eyes with morning dew, breast milk or the act of pulling the ear to stop the virus. "These are myths and rituals that do not have scientific proofs, and worse, putting morning dew in the eye might actually irritate the eye because the plant might have dust particles", said Rivera. She added the best way to cure sore eyes is to seek medical attention for the right medicine or eye drop appropriate for the case. Rivera also said proper personal hygiene especially proper hand washing helps keep the viruses away and spreading. (Hilda Austria) Back to Homepage Comments WEB MIRRORING
Visitors from almost a dozen countries recently learned about tobacco grown in what several people referred to as "the greatest tobacco region in the world." Representatives from Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Greece, Jordan, the Netherlands, the Philippines and Greece, along with a few U.S. tobacco buyers, visited two Virginia tobacco farms and a tobacco receiving station Aug. 20. It was part of Tobacco Associates Inc.'s 2015 International U.S. Leaf Grading School Tobacco Farm Production and Industry Tour. The event was co-hosted by the Virginia Farm Bureau Federation, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the Virginia Tobacco Board. At JF Leaf Ltd. in Mecklenburg County, the students learned about grower Jim Jennings' leaf grading system. They also learned that one researcher, Dr. David Reed, found that reducing fuel consumption in tobacco drying barns can also improve curing efficiency. Reed works at the Southern Piedmont Regional Agricultural Research and Extension Center. To read the entire article pick up the Sept. 9 edition of the Brunswick Times-Gazette.
1. 460. Once upon a time, there was a big hat. The big hat flew up in the air and landed in California. It landed in Southern California. It landed in Strawbed, California. The hat landed upside down. It filled up with water and turned into a lake. It was Nowhere Lake. In the middle of Nowhere Lake was an island. The island was shaped like a dog, so it was called Dog Island. But dogs didn't live on Dog Island; cats did. The End.
Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Each time you take a ride with Uber, you have the option to submit a 0-5 star rating for your driver. He or she also has the same option, providing each rider with a rating of their own. Typically, you can sort of gauge where you stand and how good your rating is by seeing what sorts of rides appear. If you're getting a lot of 4.5 star drivers, it seems (at least to me) that your score might be around that same area. Now you can know your score for sure. Uber recently began allowing riders to request their Uber score, which provides their actual rating on a 0-5 scale. Wondering why your friend always seems to get a ride faster, and you're stuck on the curb? Maybe it's because your score is low and his or her score is really high. Here's all you need to do: Open Uber Tap the Account icon on the top left Tap Help Tap Account Tap "I'd like to know my rating." Uber will then send you an email letting you know where you stand. BuzzFeed says you should receive an email that looks something like this: Hopefully your score is better.

Comment ﹞ print ﹞ T T T+﹞ T- An awareness programme to promote heart health, titled Care Your Heart, will be implemented in schools in the State, Health Minister V.S. Sivakumar has said. Inaugurating the World Heart Day observance here on Tuesday, he said that to promote heart health and the culture of physical activity, a walkway would be constructed at Shanghumughom. The programme was organised by the Kerala Heart Foundation and the Department of Cardiology, Medical College Hospital, here. A sophisticated cath lab will be set up for Rs.5 crore at the cardiology department at MCH. Dedicated floors for cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery will be available once the multi-speciality block at MCH is completed. The cardiology and cardiothoracic wing at Kottayam MCH will be elevated as Regional Heart Institute. T.K. Jayakumar, head of the CVTS department at Kottayam MCH, who led the first heart transplant in the public sector, was honoured by Health Minister. A free medical camp for checking lipid profile and blood sugar levels was arranged on the occasion. Walks, seminars, and heart health medical camps were organised on the day by Indian Association of Clinical Cardiologists. IACC, in a statement here, called on the government to strictly impose the ban on smoking in public places and to restrict the advertisements of fast food and tobacco as immediate measures to promote a healthy environment for heart health. The environment in which one lives can influence one's choices, it pointed out.
Tolhurst won t be prosecuted, even though he technically contravened the Municipal Election Act. Watson won t have to pay for the auditor as contraventions in Tolhurst s expenses were technically found. That s what the legislation says, and the committee went in camera with the city lawyer to get clarity around that before reaching their decision. Lots of people showed up for this meeting. Delegations spoke for and against the action. The committee itself seemed pretty frustrated with the process and not necessarily of a single mind. Hoping the Ministry of Municipal Affairs will get wind of this and that it makes a difference as the Municipal Election Act is under review. Here s the story
"Until one is committed, there is hesitancy ＃ the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has a genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now." -William Hutchison Murray (sometimes attributed to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)

One of the most surprising things about last months VMAs was that when Miley Cyrus "accidentally" exposed her nipple, people were generally pretty chill about it. Don t forget that this is the country that shamed Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson into a public apology for their infamous wardrobe malfunction at the Super Bowl halftime show. But it turns out not everyone let out a collective shrug, as Rolling Stone has obtained a handful of complaints from people all across the country who simply couldn t deal with seeing a human nipple on live TV, during a broadcast that is notorious for pushing boundaries. The reactions varied from the sort of ridiculous to the completely absurd, and many were packed with spelling mistakes. This comes from a totally relaxed and very busy person from Mississippi: "Miley Cyrus is a VERY TROUBLED CHILD and I can not believe what she was able to get away with on this show. Seems like she is in the news everywhere doing disgusting, perverted and lewd things. I just can t understand why this CHILD gets away with all of this." A liberal and mellow person from Virginia wrote, "Miley Cyrus said tits and showed a tit for a second. Before that, there were multiple words that were not okay, including horny ." Check out Rolling Stone for the rest. You ll want to. 
Many in today s society are dying and suffering disability prematurely primarily because of poor lifestyle choices. Poor nutritional choices, fast food has replaced healthy wholesome home cooking. Daily exercising has been replacedd with video games, internet, social media, and other forms of entertainment that require primarily sitting and watching. Inadequate consumption of water, which has been replaced with soda, sugary drinks, sports drinks, tea, and coffee. Also, insufficient exposure to daily sunlight is apparent, many exposure s to sunlight is leaving to work and school, then coming home again when sunlight is inadequate. Over eating and drinking is apparent when we consider the epidemic proportions of childhood and adult obesity. Little experience fresh air due to long hours at work, computer usage, and simply sedentary lifestyles. Few experience proper rest, at least 7 to 8 hours daily. And we all need to trust in God, avoiding worry and stress, believing he will supply all our needs.

TIANJIN - The Tianjin government has started appraising apartments damaged in last month s massive blasts, local authorities said on Sunday. The municipal government has selected Fangda Real Estate Appraisal Company to assess apartments in seven residential compounds, where more than 17,000 units were damaged by the Aug 12 blasts. The company will suggest whether an apartment requires rebuilding or buyback, said Huang Jisheng, general manager of the company. The appraised value will be compared with the contract value of the apartments, and the higher price will be used for buyback, he said. In addition, another 30 percent of value will be provided to residents as compensation, he added. Two blasts tore through a warehouse that stored large amounts of toxic chemicals at the Tianjin port late on Aug 12. A total of 165 people, including 99 firefighters and 11 police officers, were killed. Eight people, mainly firefighters, are still missing. Hundreds of the injured remain in hospitals.

Johannesburg, Sept.7 : Australia have roped in top-order batsman Peter Handscomb and all rounder John Hastings into the squad for remaining ODIs of the five-match series against England. The duo replaced all-rounder Shane Watson and fast bowler Nathan Coulter-Nile, who were ruled out of the series due to injuries.

Wicketkeeper-batsman Handscomb has not yet featured at senior international level, while Hastings has played one Test, 11 ODIs and three Twenty20 internationals. Australia are currently leading by 2-0 in the series after getting a 64-run win against England in the second ODI at Lord's in London. The two sides will now lock horns in the third ODI at Old Trafford on September 8. (ANI) The post appeared first on The Siasat Daily .
Staff Photo September 9th is National Teddy Bear Day. Teddy bears have magical power. They can soothe broken heart, scare monsters out from under the bed, be faithful companions and make people feel loved. Teddy bears are named for president Theodore Roosevelt. He was on a hunting trip in Mississippi, in 1902, when he spotted a bear cub & couldn't bring himself to shoot it. A cartoon subsequently appeared in the Washington Post. Morris & Rose MIchton reportedly contacted president Roosevelt seeking permission to call their stuffed bears "Teddy Bears." The bears were a hit, and the Michton's operation grew to become the Ideal Toy Company.

NEW YORK ( MainStreet ) 〞 For decades, safari vacations have involved journeys through Africa s great game reserves, and days spent traveling into the wild to spot zebras, elephants and lions. But there s a new type of safari emerging, one that involves tracking down an entirely different species - consumer goods made by Gucci, Prada, or Rolex, rare antiques, fine silks or the work of artists in developing countries. Referred to by a recent travel industry report as "shopping safaris" - this type of vacation is on the rise, most notably among Chinese nationals. The 2015 Tourism & Travel Trends Report from Resonance Consultancy identifies shopping safaris as one of many growing trends to watch, revealing for example that 27% of Chinese tourists abroad spend more on shopping when traveling than anything else. And one of the most popular shopping oriented vacation destinations, according to the report, is the United States. So while the U.S. may have plenty of sights to offer tourists -- the Grand Canyon or the Statue of Liberty -- they are less popular with some Chinese travelers then days spent at discount outlets and malls. "It s not unusual for them to fill an entire extra suitcase," says Gary Young, who regularly hosts Chinese tourists, thanks to his role as president and CEO of Avela Corporation, a company that has offices in China and Texas and specializes in helping American companies make purchases in Asia. next last

 candidates , Lok Sabha constituency , Monday , seats , wanted , withdraws New Delhi, Sept. 21 (ANI): The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) on Monday withdrew its candidate from the Chakai seat to avoid friction within the NDA ahead of the Bihar Assembly polls. Declaring the second list of candidates for the Bihar polls, LJP parliamentary board Chairman Chirag Paswan said that his party wanted to contest on both seats but it compromised in order to avoid infighting within the NDA. "We wanted both the seats but there are certain problems of the parties of the grand alliance. Our mission is to form a strong NDA Government. If we create problem then all the parties in alliance will have to bear its responsibility," Paswan told the media here. "We decided that a candidate from HAM party will fight the election from Jamui- Chakai seat and Vijay Singh from Lok Janshakti Party will fight election for another seat," he added. Hindusthani Awam Morcha (HAM) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi had sought Chakai Assembly seat for HAM (S) leader Narendra Singh's son Sumit Kumar Singh, the sitting MLA from Chakai for which LJP had also staked its claim given that it falls under Lok Sabha constituency of Chirag Paswan, an MP from Jamui. Polls to the 243-member Bihar Assembly will be held in five phases starting on October 12 and ending on November 5. Counting of votes will take place on November 8. (ANI)

(Got(Adds background)) CAIRO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Egypt will return to the international bond market in the first half of 2016, the country s finance minister said on Monday, taking advantage of its return to economic and political stability in the wake of the Arab Spring uprising of 2011. "We will go out to the international bond market in the second half of the financial year 2015-16, God willing," Hany Kadry Dimian told Reuters on the sidelines of a Euromoney conference. Egypt s financial year runs from July to June. The government conducted its first international bond sale in five years in June, selling $1.5 billion of 10-year bonds at a yield of 6 percent after receiving more than $4.5 billion in investor orders. Foreign portfolio investors left the country en masse in 2011, freezing it out of the international debt market after an uprising toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak. But economic growth has begun to pick up and state finances have strengthened since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi took office last year. He has overseen the launch of economic reforms and forged an alliance with rich Gulf Arab states to obtain aid and investment.

Posted Thursday, September 10th 2015 @ 9am by Eric Owens Take comfort, America, because today's high school freshmen are just as immature as you were at the especially dumb age of 14. The difference is: These kids today have smartphones, and they know how to use them. The kerfuffle that proves it all beyond the shadow of a doubt occurred on Aug. 28 at Memorial High School in Houston, according to local NBC affiliate KPRC . Principal Lisa Weir invited freshman students at the affluent high school to an assembly in the auditorium. The plan was to allow individual students to ask questions anonymously, via their mobile phones. Then, the questions would appear on a huge screen in front of the room for the entire gaggle of 14-year-old kids to see. Predictably, Weir's plan became a disaster as quick as you can pop a blackhead. The students realized they could type any messages they wanted into their phones and those messages would appear on the big screen. And thus did immature chaos soon ensue. "Im hungry [sic]," wrote one student. "Miley Cyrus for president," wrote another. Other messages which appeared on the auditorium screen at the assembly included "Sexy boots," "When ur stoned af" and "hi welcome to chillies [sic]." Read more from The Daily Caller
Q 每 Why can't I chew meat as well with dentures as I did with my natural teeth? A 每 With natural teeth a person chews with a force of approximately 150 to 200 pounds per square inch, but with dentures the maximum biting force is reduced to approximately 40 to 50 pounds per square inch. Chewing is also made more difficult by the fact that lower dentures are never stable. There are no roots to hold them in place, and the tongue displaces them. To ease your difficulty chewing, try cutting your meat into smaller pieces and placing equal amounts on each side of your mouth. This will help stabilize the lower denture while you chew. However, the more desirable solution would be to have an implanted overdenture. The implants act as natural roots and keep the dentures in place while eating. If you would like to once again chew your food with comfort and ease contact McCabe Denture Clinic & Implant Solutions at 519-623-7702 to book a complimentary consultation. We will give you the care and attention you deserve.
Story highlights The Chinese ships were doing operations "consistent with international law," U.S. officials told CNN This is a first for Chinese naval ships -- and the transit took place while President Barack Obama was in Alaska The Chinese ships were doing operations "consistent with international law," U.S. officials told CNN, under the maritime rule of "innocent passage," where ships are permitted to enter territorial waters and are not challenged so long as they keep moving directly and expeditiously. U.S. officials emphasized that Russian warships exercise "innocent passage" around Alaska with regularity. However, this is a first for Chinese naval ships -- and the transit took place while President Barack Obama was in Alaska. U.S. Northern Command, whose area of responsibility includes all air, land and sea approaches to the continental U.S. and Alaska, told CNN it is not aware of any communications between the U.S. and Chinese military during the passage. When a CNN crew was aboard a U.S. P8 surveillance aircraft near manmade islands off the coast of China -- islands the U.S. does not recognize as Chinese territory -- the Chinese military warned the flight crew eight times to leave Chinese territory immediately. Asked about the difference, a defense official told CNN that as a matter of policy, the U.S. does not challenge ships executing safe transit through U.S. territorial waters, in part to be consistent with its history of challenging other nation s excessive territorial claims.
If you re a Kardashian or a Jenner, you re used to being in the spotlight. But Kendall Jenner is well on her way to becoming a fashion icon in her own right - she even dropped Jenner as her last name professionally to prove she didn t need the famous family name help. After carefully studying her beauty style since she was just a little girl, we can theorize that she was always meant to be in front of the camera. Oh, and she was also a total trendsetter, taking on braids, cat eyes, and metallic eye makeup looks that are still popular today. Gear up for another month of Kendall on the runway by seeing her evolution from the most adorable child to the undeniably chic and sexy young woman we know (and obsessively tweet about) today. Those Marc Jacobs and Chanel runway credits? She earned them! But perhaps you ll have to see it to believe it . . .
NEW Zealand has turned to a current-account deficit in the second quarter with the country earning less from the export of travel services, such as tourist spending. THE current-account deficit was $NZ1.2 billion ($A1.07 billion) in the three months ended June 30, from a revised surplus of $NZ821 million a year earlier, Statistics New Zealand said on Wednesday. The annual deficit was $NZ8.3b, or 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product, from a revised gap of $NZ8.06b, or 3.4 per cent, three months earlier. The deficit means the nation is spending more than it earns. The balance on goods was a reduced surplus of $NZ679m in the latest quarter, from a revised $NZ845m a year earlier as goods exports widened to $NZ12.7b and goods imports rose to $NZ12.01b. The surplus on services narrowed to $NZ488m from $NZ2.23b three months earlier, as exports of travel services fell to $NZ2.76b from $NZ4.15b. The income balance was unchanged at $NZ2.2b.

LOS ANGELES (CNS) 〞 The Federal Aviation Administration is proposing a $211,000 civil penalty against a Northridge-based aerospace industry supplier for allegedly violating federal drug and alcohol testing regulations, it was announced. The FAA alleges that Dukes Aerospace, Inc. failed to include four of its "safety-sensitive" employees in random drug and alcohol testing pools and failed to receive verified negative results before transferring nine employees into safety sensitive positions. A request for comment left with a spokeswoman for Dukes corporate owner TransDigm Group Inc. in Cleveland, Ohio, was not immediately answered. Federal regulators further contend that Dukes failed to ask 10 safety- sensitive employees whether they had tested positive or had refused to submit to a pre-employment drug or alcohol test at other companies where they had applied for safety-sensitive transportation work during the previous two years. The company also allegedly did not use a scientifically valid method of random selection for drug testing, and conducted a random drug test on two employees rather than the alcohol test for which they had been selected. Dukes has requested to meet with the FAA to discuss the case, according to the agency. Founded in 1958, Dukes specializes in the manufacture and support of fuel pumps, solenoids, pneumatic valves and cabin pressure control systems for the aerospace, marine and space markets.
Authorities have nabbed a man who s accused of spray-painting images of Sasquatch on public property in Kennebunk, Maine. Police in the picturesque coastal town didn t find the graffiti featuring Bigfoot all that amusing and charged 36-year-old Freeman Hatch with criminal mischief and possession of drugs. He s due in court in November. Police Chief Robert MacKenzie says the Sasquatches defaced public and private property and cost "time and money to repair or replace." Sasquatch is the folkloric beast thought by some people to roam the forests, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Police say the graffiti was concentrated around Kennebunk Beach. A phone number for Hatch can t be located. It s unknown if he has a lawyer who could comment on the charges.

It breaks my heart seeing people dumping their trash on the ground Dubai has been my second home for 15 years. I witnessed the drastic change in its economy, but it saddens me today to see the streets, parking lots and pavements littered with trash. I came here in the year 2000 and the first thing that impressed me was the cleanliness of its streets. People before were more cautious and more concerned of the environment. It breaks my heart seeing people dumping their trash on the ground with the garbage containers just around the corner. Can we just help and be responsible for our waste? I hope government will implement stricter rules for littering and impose a hefty fine. Expat 2k, Dubai Share this

Having a timeless and stylish design, the present generation W222 Mercedes-Benz S-Class creates a great personalization choice when it comes to luxury limos. While you are all aware, the S63 AMG sits close to the pinnacle of German limousine performance and engineering, with 585 PS and 900 Nm (663 lb-foot) of torque to you disposal, you are certainly not short on tugging energy when driving this vehicle. The inside includes a carbon fibre strip over the dashboard in addition to a blue ambient lighting theme which obviously could be transformed based on requirements. They are known as the ADV10 Track Spec CS wheels plus they feature Custom Magno Alanit rims along with a Polished Aluminum lip. The yellow calipers give a nice contrast towards the entire picture. As I wouldn't go so far as to state this is among the best-searching S63's we have seen around here recently, the wheel design does stick out when you stop and extremely seriously consider all of the particulars and just how everything fits together, dvds, calipers, rims and lips. Browse the gallery and let's read your comments. Obviously, to many people, driving is not everything, that is where certain exterior mods are available in for example whenever you decrease your vehicle onto some quality custom wheels. Such may be the situation using these ADV.1s, calculating 22℅9.5 in front and 22℅11 in the rear. PHOTO GALLERY The post appeared first on News List Online .

The chair of the Little Rock Tech Park Authority told CU Times that it doesn't care whether banks or credit unions provide the financing for the community development project, and that Arkansas Federal Credit Union will be given a second chance to provide a loan for the project. The $998 million, 93,000-member, Jacksonville, Ark.-based cooperative had been part of a coalition to provide $17.5 million to the project until a complaint from the Arkansas Bankers Association ended up forcing it out . Mary Good, chair of the Tech Park Authority, laid out the project leaders' position on the matter in an email. "The Tech Park has no preference for financing partners and were happy with the original list of potential providers," Good wrote. "We had no input into the revised group and would welcome any group that provides for our needs and gets their proposal in on our timeline. If the credit union does not become part of this package, there will be other major opportunities down the line."

The second album recorded by King Diamond following his departure from Mercyful Fate (along with bandmates Michael Denner and Timi Hansen) in 1985, Abigail tells the tale of a young couple, Miriam Natias and Jonathan La'Fey, who suffer the repercussions of moving into a haunted mansion back in 1845. The first concept album for the band, Abigail introduced some memorable metal tracks like "Arrival," "The Possession" and "The 7th Day of July 1777." The band released a follow up to the "story" with successor, Abigail II: The Revenge, in 2002.

:41 Tsvetan Tsvetanov, 32, was brought to the hearing in handcuffs 〞 both on his hands and feet 〞 and under heavy police escort. He was arrested in his home in a Roma neighbourhood of Lom in northwest Bulgaria on Monday on an European arrest warrant issued by Austrian prosecutors. Appearing in court in the Bulgarian town of Montana, he kept silent when asked by journalists if he was the driver of the truck but answered "No" when asked if he knew that he was carrying people inside. According to the charge sheet he allegedly drove the truck, found on an Austrian motorway near the Hungarian border last Thursday, "at least some of the distance from Hungary to Austria." The court was due to examine an Austrian extradition request on Monday. The charges include "participation in an organised crime group, contraband trafficking and premeditated manslaughter of 71 people," Montana regional prosecutor Nina Borisova told the court. Another five men, four Bulgarians and an Afghan, have so far been detained in Hungary. Austrian police were due on Friday to release autopsy results of the 71 men, women and children, thought to be Syrians and to have suffocated up to two days before the truck was discovered. 2015 AFP

A spirit of tolerance has to be inculcated," the Supreme Court bench said. The bench also said that the authority should be tolerant towards people opposing the ban. "Compassion should not be there only during festival. It has to be shown throughout the year", it added. The top court asked the High Court to decide within six months whether the sale of meat should be banned during religious festivals. The bench was hearing a petition filed by a religious body challenging HC order on lifting the ban.

Floyd County 911 has completed testing of all equipment, processes and training required to implement Text-to-911. This allows those within the boundaries of Floyd County, who have an emergency, a registered cell phone with a text plan, and the inability to make a voice call, to send 911 an SMS text message. Appropriate times to text 911 instead of calling 911 would be when the caller is unable to call due to the caller being Deaf, having a speech or hearing impairment, or being in a situation where making a voice call would endanger the caller. We are very excited to have this capability and provide direct access to Floyd County's significant Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and Speech Impaired communities. On Sept. 15, 2015 at 10 a.m., Floyd County 911 will host a member of the Deaf community who will be representing the Northwest Georgia Center for Independent Living to make the first ceremonial Text to Floyd County 911. Media representatives are invited to attend. Space is limited.

It s a double post day! I just couldn t wait to show you these awesome stained glass nails that I created with all five of the fall polishes from Bellaluna Cosmetics. I think it was obvious that I loved these polishes in just swatches, so it is always fun to see how a whole collection looks together. You can see the swatches here, but the colors are Near Dark (dark grey), Spanish Moss (olive green), Frosted Eggplant (purple), Autumn Woodlands (pumpkin spice), and Sparkling Cranberry (red). I used my new Uber Chic Mat to create decals for each nail and it really let me be precise with my lines and filling in each space vs. trying to do it freehand. As a notorious desk ruiner I need an oversized mat to cover the whole desk top! I m so in love with the way these came out. Be sure to check out the shop and social links below!

New Delhi - Indian police have offered a reward for the fugitive owner of illegally stored explosives which ripped through a crowded restaurant and killed 88 people after an accidental detonation, an officer said on Monday. Police are hunting for businessman Rajendra Kasawa following Saturday s blast that tore apart the restaurant building complex in Madhya Pradesh state, packed with office workers and schoolchildren eating breakfast. Scores of labourers waiting at a bus stop outside the complex were also hit by debris from the blast, which destroyed neighbouring buildings in the town of Petlawad. Eighty-eight people were killed and about 100 injured in the worst such accident in India in recent years. Kasawa had a licence for the gelignite and other explosives used for digging wells and in the construction and mining industries. But storing them in residential and other densely populated areas is illegal. Additional police superintendent Seema Alva said an officer has since been suspended for failing to enforce the laws on storage. "We have also announced a cash award of 100 000 rupees ($1 500) for anyone who provides any information on the main accused, who is absconding," Alva told AFP. Kasawa fled the area after the explosion and faces charges of criminal negligence and culpable homicide, police have said. Television footage on Saturday showed scores of people and rescue workers using their bare hands to shift mangled heaps of steel and concrete from the ruined buildings. Corpses were covered in dust and ash coated the streets alongside the twisted wreckage of burned-out vehicles. AFP

1:28 a.m. CDT (Reuters) - At least seven people were killed and several others were missing after heavy rains triggered flash flooding near Utah s border with Arizona, local officials said late on Monday. The downpour damage to streets around the southern city of Hildale, Utah, and several vehicles were washed downstream, said Hildale assistant fire chief Kevin Barlow. At least 16 people in different vehicles were caught in the flash flooding, a result of fast and heavy rains in the nearby canyons, Barlow said. Two cars were hit by a "large wall of water," Washington County officials said in a Facebook post. Seven people were confirmed dead and one was hospitalized. Several others were still missing, and rescue crews were working to find the victims and clear mud and debris from streets, Barlow said. All the people who died were believed to have been trapped in their cars and unable to escape the rushing waters, he said. (Reporting by Victoria Cavaliere)
Press Release 每 Mumbai Press Club condemns Sanathan Sanstha threats against scribe Mumbai Press Club notes with serious concern the Sanatan Sansthna targeting Shaymsundar Sonnar, a senior journalist with a Marathi newspaper Prahaar and senior journalist Nikhil Wagle. In view of arrests of people associated with Sanatan Prabhat in connection with veteran secularist and Leftist leader Comrade Govind Pansare s murder, Sonnar has filed a formal police complaint and has asked the police for protection for him and his family from the right wing organisation. Sanatan Prabhat wrote an article targeting Sonnar for his interpretation of Sant Tukaram s pro-science preaching. Sonnar is a vaarkari preacher who is invited by people across Maharashtra for kirtans and public speeches. His rationalist views are very much appreciated and well accepted. The newspaper s article which appeared on Sept 1, 2015, spat venom against the senior journalist and called him anti-Hindu. Nikhil Wagle, a senior journalist, is also under threat. He is getting threat from Sanatan Sanstha since 2011. Maharashtra police has also found that Nikhil s name was mentioned regularly in the telephonic conversation between arrested Samir Gaikwad and some other members of Sanatan Sanstha including absconder Rudra Patil. Mumbai police officials recently met Nikhil and requested him for the police protection. Nikhil has refused security as it will hamper his journalistic activities. The Mumbai Press Club fully stands behind Sonnar and Wagle and his family members and calls upon the Mumbai Police and the MaharashtraGovernment to take serious note of it.-- Pl see my blogs; http://ambedkaractions.blogspot.in/ http://palashscape.blogspot.in/ Feel free -- and I request you -- to forward this newsletter to your lists and friends!

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne delivers a speech at the Shanghai Stock Exchange in Shanghai, China, September 22, 2015. REUTERS/Aly Song LONDON (Reuters) - A Chinese firm plans to provide investment to launch three housing projects in northern England, Britain s finance ministry said on Wednesday as finance minister George Osborne toured China to boost business ties. Hualing Industry and Trade Group, based in China s Xinjiang region, intends to invest 60 million pounds ($92.2 million) to kick off the three projects in Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield which will have a final gross value of 1.2 billion pounds. The ministry said the projects, led by Britain s Scarborough Group, are expected to deliver 10,000 new homes, part of the government s efforts to spur development in northern England which has lagged growth in London and the Southeast. Osborne said he was aiming to make China the second-biggest trading partner of Britain by 2025, compared with its number-six ranking now. Earlier this week, Britain and China announced initiatives including an expanded currency swap agreement, Chinese investment in British nuclear power and a study for a scheme to connect the London and Shanghai stock markets. Osborne also announced 10 million pounds in extra funding to enable thousands more British schoolchildren to learn Mandarin by 2020. (Writing by William Schomberg; editing by Andy Bruce)

Ukrainian cruiserweight hope Oleksandr Usyk made it eight straight knockouts since turning professional with a third round stoppage of hard South African Jonny Muller in Kiev. The 28 year-old, who won European, World and Olympic gold medals as an amateur, looks the business at the 200lb limit as he ploughs his way through some decent fighters, and to some, is nailed on to be a world champion in the near future. Already a fringe WBO title holder, Usyk is on the fast-track to an opportunity at one of the top operators in the division and could conceivably be ready within the next twelve months on recent evidence.

A soldier injured in a parachute training accident in western Montana has been released from the hospital and is back training with his unit. The U.S. Army Special Operations Command says the soldier suffered only minor injuries when he landed on a street in Hamilton on Tuesday. He was released from a Missoula hospital on Wednesday after being treated for a couple of bruises. The Army described the parachute accident as a minor malfunction where the soldier was not able to slow the descent of his chute to the desired speed. The jump was part of military free-fall training being held in western Montana. It is scheduled to wrap up on Friday.
A Chinese man was reportedly arrested after posting a selfie next to what seemed to be his dead girlfriend. On September 6, police in Nanning, China set out to investigate a murder. Later that day, police allegedly received additional reports about a photograph featuring a dead woman posted on an unspecified social network. According to Daily Mail , the photo supposedly showed a man with the last name Qin near the allegedly dead body. Other photos released by Chinese media show a rural, secluded area and a handsaw. This caption was reportedly alongside the selfie: Forgive me for my selfish love. Qin is thought to have allegedly killed the woman after an argument at which point he took a photo next to the dead body and fled the scene. The original post could only be viewed on local social media, but it was soon shared on numerous Chinese websites. The photo had only been online for a matter of hours when Qin was reportedly arrested not far from the alleged murder setting. Qin may not have been convicted just yet, however, as the death remains under investigation. Man Arrested For Allegedly Killing His GF And Taking A Selfie With Her

ST. JOHN S, N.L. 〞 A day after the mayor of a small Newfoundland town said his "dysfunctional" council should be dissolved, its six other members are suggesting the real problem is a resistance to change. Sam Synard has been mayor of Marystown for 15 years but the council voted for him to resign this week over an alleged conflict of interest. Synard denies any wrongdoing and has called for an early election 〞 which the province says only happens in extreme cases of dysfunction. In a news release today the six other councillors say they work well together but have been hampered by "negativity, insults and belittling" without naming anyone at the centre of their allegation. They also suggest their efforts to improve "older, ineffective practices" can mean difficult adjustments. Synard was acclaimed and five new members won four-years terms just two years ago.

Big Screen rather. Rumor has it that DC is breaking out these two for a super-hero buddy copy movie to be released next year (I think). Foremost, these two have some of the coolest costumes in the super-hero industry. They just look cool, the color, the design. All of it. Secondly, I m not sure they can carry their own movie. Third, I know they can. IF they did this right, styling it like the just released Ant Man, then it has a real chance. Buddy cop movies are a long tradition but aren t, for the most part, that good on the screen. The ultimate has to be Running Scared. That movie captured the perfect mix of comedy, serious, action, drama and everyone was an understatement of their character, meaning, no one was larger than life. Just a realistic movie, but and and dangerous. If they do it like that, its got a real chance.

 Everton midfielder must do 200 hours community work Cyclist received cuts and 4,500 bike was written off The Everton midfielder Darron Gibson has pleaded guilty to hitting a cyclist while drink-driving and then fleeing the scene. Gibson, 27, was behind the wheel of his black Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo when it ploughed into three cyclists who had stopped at the side of the road to fix a broken chain. The cyclist directly hit by Gibson's car received cuts to his legs, elbow and hand and his 4,500 carbon composite bike was written off. The former Manchester United player was said to have driven off at speed before he pulled into a petrol station nearby in his home town of Bowdon, Cheshire, and collided with a petrol pump. Police were called by a concerned petrol attendant after Gibson then got out of his car with no shoes on and filled his vehicle with fuel on the morning of 16 August. The Republic of Ireland international entered guilty pleas at Trafford magistrates' court to driving with excess alcohol, driving without due care and attention and failing to stop after an accident had occurred. Chair of the bench Susanne O'Connell told Gibson that the failure to stop offence was "serious enough" to merit a community penalty. He was banned from driving for 20 months and sentenced to a 12-month community order, with an unpaid work requirement of 200 hours. He was ordered to pay compensation of 4,500 for the damaged bicycle and 1,000 to the injured rider Philip Quinn, plus 100 each to the two other cyclists. Gibson was also told to pay 295 court costs.

Goldman Sachs has hired Adam Savarese to join its distressed debt trading desk, according to people familiar with the matter. Savarese, who was at Morgan Stanley previously, is a big name in the distressed debt world. He will join Goldman Sachs as a partner, a sign of his seniority. Goldman Sachs rarely makes hires at partner level. Savarese will work with Tom Tormey, according to the people. Tormey was named partner late last year. The desk - which trades the debt of companies in financial distress - is a part of the bank s credit trading business. His appointment follows a tough period for Goldman Sachs in the distressed debt trading space. Bloomberg reported in August that the bank had taken a $50 million to $60 million hit as a result of a series of bad bets. The team has also seen a number of departures. Jerry Keefe, who had co-headed the desk, left in March to join a hedge fund, while fellow co-head Dennis Lafferty was recently reported to be in talks to join HSBC . Savarese started at Goldman Sachs in 1999, according to his LinkedIn profile, and joined Morgan Stanley in 2002, according to FINRA records. He was named a managing director at the bank in 2009. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Morgan Stanley did not comment in time for publication. Savarese did not return messages seeking comment. Please enable Javascript to watch this video
Share this article: Hearing Impairment Linked to Mortality (HealthDay News) 〞 For older adults with hearing impairment (HI), moderate or more severe impairment is associated with mortality in an age-adjusted model, according to a research letter published online September 24 in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery . Kevin J. Contrera, MPH, from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, and colleagues used combined data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to examine 1,666 adults aged ≡70 years who had undergone audiometric testing (527 without HI; 1,139 with HI). The authors examined the correlation between HI and mortality. The researchers found that, compared to individuals without HI, mortality was significantly increased for those with moderate or more severe HI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08每2.18) and increased for those with mild HI (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.83每1.95), in an age-adjusted model. The risk was attenuated after further adjustment for demographic characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors (moderate or more severe HI: HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.97每2.01; mild HI: HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.81每1.81). "Future studies are required to explore the basis of the association of HI with mortality and to determine whether therapies to rehabilitate hearing can reduce mortality," the authors write. One author disclosed financial ties to Cochlear, Autifony, Pfizer, Med-El, and Amplifon. Full Text (subscription or payment may be required)
Suspected migrant activity has suspended Channel Tunnel rail services between the UK and France, Eurostar said. The train operator tweeted concerned passengers, who were left stranded both inside and outside the tunnel after services were halted, saying: "Trains are waiting to enter the tunnel as trespassers are on the tracks at Calais, the authorities are on site to help."

One of the main problems of western societies is the increasing isolation of older people, who do not actively participate in society. The ALFRED project will help to overcome this problem with an interactive virtual butler for older people, which aims to provide a high end-user acceptance by using a fully voice controlled and non-technical user interface, which will allow a seamless support for tasks in and outside the home and empower them to live independently longer. In the meantime, it aims also to slow down age-related physical and cognitive impairments with the help of personalized serious games, and to foster active participation in society by suggesting and managing events and social contacts. In the same context the programm will improve the caring process by offering direct access to vital signs for (informal) carers. The data is collected by unobtrusive wearable sensors monitoring the vital signs allowing alerts in case of inconsistencies. Find out more at the programms website HERE.
SOURCE Memory Care Living RAMSEY, N.J. Memory Care Living is moving away from using anti-psychotic drugs and instead uses behavioral tracking to meet the needs of residents. Memory Care Living has 13 communities throughout New Jersey Cheryl Salo "Memory Care Living s goal is to increase the cognitive and physical activity of our residents. We learn about our residents and track actions to find the reason behind their challenging behaviors without resorting to antipsychotics," Salo said. In 2005, The FDA issued a public health advisory to alert health care providers and patients about increased mortality associated with anti-psychotic drugs used by patients with dementia. Despite the warning, a 2015 Danish psychotropic drug study suggests over 75 percent of patients with dementia are treated with anti-psychotic medications. The move away from institutionalized care is new to the senior healthcare industry. Memory Care Living is a leading provider of elder care, focusing specifically on Alzheimer s disease and dementia.

WASHINGTON 〞 A range of contentious issues between the U.S. and China that impact the fashion industry are heating up ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Washington on Friday, and factions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill and President Obama to GOP presidential contenders and the private sector are weighing in. Xi will visit Washington with his wife, Peng Liyuan, for a state visit that will include a highly anticipated Rose Garden press conference and a formal state dinner at the White House. China is important to the fashion industry's sourcing strategies and exports. It is the top supplier of apparel and textiles to the U.S., controlling a 38.7 percent share of the U.S. import market and importing $42.8 billion for the year ending July 31, according to U.S. government data. Several thorny, outstanding issues directly impacting the industry are pending, as Xi comes to Washington. They include: 〞 A World Trade Organization case filed by the U.S. against China in February targeting a broad Chinese export subsidy program in seven sectors, including apparel, textiles and footwear, that could have broad ramifications for sourcing. 〞 A spat over China's cotton supply. The U.S. asserted at a WTO meeting in June that China's stockpiling of cotton has distorted world cotton prices Follow WWD on Twitter or become a fan on Facebook . Read More...

When it comes to sleep, the sweet spot is seven to nine hours. Sleeping for fewer than six hours or more than 10 hours each night has been linked to chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity, according to a study from the CDC. Another stress to your body is hitting the snooze button. Disrupting your sleep diminishes the benefits of rest, leaving you more tired than if you had gotten up the first time the alarm went off, explains Dr. Yizhak Kupfer, assistant director of critical care and pulmonary medicine at Maimonides Medical Center in Booklyn, NY.
In a recent interview, Nicole Kidman revealed that she and Keith never E-mail and rarely text. She said, "We never do. Once in a blue moon, we'll text. But mainly we say, 'I want to hear your voice.' That's very unusual, but we've been together for 10 years. We started like that and we haven't changed it... It's about trying to keep it as intimate and personal as possible." Keith is also willing to schedule major tours around his wife's film schedule. Last year, when Nicole's work had her in Australia for six weeks for the thriller Strangerland , Keith tried to plan a tour Down Under just to be on the same continent as his wife.
Police have apologised to residents after sounding sirens - to settle a debate about whether "they go nee-nah or woo-woo". The sirens were used during a talk given by police community support officers (PCSOs) to pupils at Haydonleigh Primary School in Swindon, Wiltshire. North Swindon Police said the PCSOs were holding a "People Who Help Us" session with three classes from the reception year on Wednesday morning. "Apologies to anyone in the Haydonleigh area who may have been disturbed by our sirens yesterday morning - the PCSOs were at the Primary School having a very important debate with the new Reception Year children about whether they go nee-nah or woo-woo," North Swindon Police said in a post on Facebook.

The first night of the college football season delivered good numbers on ESPN and Fox Sports 1. The North Carolina/South Carolina college football game drew a 2.1 overnight rating on ESPN Thursday night, down 16% from the same matchup in the same timeslot two years ago (2.5). There was no comparable early game last year. Despite the drop, the Gamecocks' win tied the fifth-highest overnight on record for an opening Thursday game on ESPN. South Carolina has played in four of the top five. The TCU/Minnesota nightcap drew a 1.9 overnight, up 27% from Boise State/Mississippi last year (1.5). Both games faced tougher competition from Fox Sports 1, which drew a 2.1 overnight for Michigan/Utah. Overnights were not immediately available for last year's Rutgers/Washington State game, but it had a mere 0.3 final rating. (Thu. overnights from ESPN Media Zone, twitter.com/austinkarp)

Orlando Pirates participated in 16 Top 8 finals, winning 10. The Urban Warriors have yet to win the Top 8 trophy, losing twice in the final "Players come to Chiefs being aware what they have to do to advance the reputation of the Club. For the new players, to win the trophy is the cherry on top of playing for Chiefs. The players at Chiefs know you are as good as your last game. Normally teams struggle to achieve a win ahead of major matches. However, with coach Steve [Komphela] its a different ball game.

We also have more stories about: (click the phrases to see a list) Subjects: Places: BANGKOK 〞 Police in Thailand say they are now certain that last month s deadly bombing at a Bangkok shrine was related to the trafficking of Uighur (WEE-gur) Muslims from China to Turkey. National police chief Somyot Poompanmoung s comments Tuesday marked the first time authorities have publicly linked the Aug. 17 bombing to the smuggling of Uighur Muslims. Somyot said the bombing was the result of a crackdown on a trafficking network "that smuggles Uighurs from one country to another." Uighurs, an ethnic minority in western China, are related to Turks, and Turkey is home to a large Uighur community. Thai authorities have avoided calling the bombing an act of terrorism, which they fear would harm Thailand s image as a tourist destination. The blast left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured.
By Ezequiel Minaya Priceline Group Inc. said Thursday it bought Australia-based AS Digital, a provider of restaurant table and reservation-management software. The Australia-based company will become part of the OpenTable brand, which the Priceline Group acquired in 2014. Priceline said in a media release that it hopes AS Digital will help its push into Australia, Japan and the Asia Pacific region. Terms of the deal weren t disclosed. AS Digital operates ResPAK, a table reservation program used by thousands of restaurants in over 40 countries, and is linked to bookarestaurant.com, Priceline said. "This move extends the group s initiatives in digital and mobile commerce and accelerates our international efforts in online dining as we continue to scale this business," said Darren Huston, Priceline s chief executive. In March, Priceline acquired hotel-booking startup Rocketmiles for about $20 million through its venture unit, a move that would help Priceline encourage customers to book lodging through its network, rather than booking directly with hotels, which offer their own rewards to lure users to their sites. In May, the company said it would increase its investment in Shanghai-based Ctrip.com International Ltd., as it sought a larger footprint in the world s largest outbound-travel market. The Priceline Group has six primary brands that include Booking.com, priceline.com , KAYAK, agoda.com, rentalcars.com, and OpenTable.

Romania s Florin Surugiu takes to the Wembley turf to propose to his girlfriend Romanian player Florin Surugiu turned his day around after losing to Ireland when he proposed to his girlfriend at Wembley. Despite in their Rugby World Cup pool game, Romania were given a standing ovation by the Wembley Stadium crowd in London. Following the lap of honour, and after most of the 89,217 spectators had left, the Romanian side walked back on to the field and faced the tunnel. The Romanian replacement scrum-half got down on one knee and popped the question in front of his teammates. Photo: @WorldSports Team/Twitter Surugiu, 30, stepped out from the squad and met his girlfriend, who had been helped down on to the green. The replacement halfback got down on one knee, and proposed in front of his teammates and stragglers in the stands. Her answer was obvious as she leapt into the arms of her fiance. Her answer? Clearly, a yes . As she accepted, the rest of the team broke into a round of applause and came over to congratulate the couple. Romania are bottom of Pool D after two games in the World Cup, having also been defeated by France last Wednesday. 
A new kind of concrete from the UK building materials company Tarmac instantly soaks up gallons and gallons of H20每simultaneously preventing flood conditions while also conserving water by cycling it directly back into the ground. It's called Tarmac Topmix Permeable, and it's a super-porous concrete pavement designed to remove storm and floodwater from parking lots, driveways, sidewalks, and other surfaces. It was designed by Britain's LaFarge Tarmac, who call the idea part of a "sustainable urban drainage system." Water enters the permeable concrete top layer, and then passes through pebbles beneath to become groundwater in the soil. In 60 seconds, it can drain 4,000 liters of water, or just over 1,000 gallons, according to a promotional video from the company. Advertisement The company says that the concrete could be installed anywhere to mitigate flood risk, but anyone who uses it should carry out a survey first to scope out any sinkholes or other possible pitfalls, literal and figurative, in the area. The one big caveat? If the concrete is installed someplace cold, the water could freeze, which would ruin the whole system. So the company's next challenge is figuring out a way to build a version of the porous concrete that can adapt to cold climates. Even if it's relegated to warmer climates for now, a sidewalk that slurps up puddles before soaking our shoes (or worse, our cars or buildings) is a great idea.

Reuters reports the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday sanctioned four Hamas officials and financiers and a Saudi Arabia-based company controlled by one of them for providing financial support to the Palestinian militant group.

We re back again with another in our weekly reading list posts, of books we think our community will find interesting and thought provoking. Once again, buying the book via the Amazon links in this story also help support Techdirt. This week s book is Pirates, Prisoners, and Lepers: Lessons from Life Outside the Law by Paul Robinson and Sarah Robinson. The book just came out earlier this year and it may be a little different than you expect. Unlike the usual "pirates" that we discuss, the part of this book about pirates is about actual pirates. Like those on the high seas. I first found out about the book on a recent episode of Russ Robert s EconTalk podcast. It focuses on how communities act when groups of people are placed in positions without a government and laws to impose social order, and how those groups function. From there it discusses some possible lessons from those groups that could be applicable back in the world where there are laws and governing bodies. One particularly interesting aspect is the idea that any justice system needs to actually mete out reasonable punishment for crimes if people are to respect the law. While many believe that, because many scofflaws "get away" with their crimes, you have to ratchet up the punishment as some sort of deterrent, Robinson argues that this leads to even less respect for the law overall. I m still only part way through the book, but between what I ve read so far and Paul Robinson s interview with Roberts, this is a worthwhile and thought provoking read.
CNN Money Friday 18th September, 2015 Nasdaq gained 0.4%. Wall Street struggled to wrap its head around what the Fed decision telegraphs about the U.S. economy. The Fed decision was one of the most highly anticipated events in recent Wall Street history. A rate hike would have been a watershed moment, the first in nearly a decade. But the Fed hesitated to act, held back by turmoil overseas and concerns over how China s economic slowdown will impact the rest of the world. But that only seems to have left investors grasping for clues on when a rate hike will actually happen next. "One thing the Fed has accomplished today is to incre...

Inside the privacy of their home, I documented as she cared for their son. These sessions are so real, and powerful moments.

TEHRAN (FNA)- Bahrainis once again took to the streets in solidarity with detained political activists. Protesters held an anti-regime rally in the Northwestern village of Diraz, located about 12 kilometers Southeast of the capital, Manama, following the Friday prayers. The protesters also called for the release of Sheikh Ali Salman, who heads Bahrain's main opposition bloc, the al-Wefaq National Islamic Society, and other prisoners of conscience. Similar rallies were also held in the village of Bilad al-Qadim, a suburb of Manama and Sitra, South of the capital. Salman was arrested on December 28, 2014, on charges of seeking regime change and collaborating with foreign powers. On June 16, a Bahraini court sentenced him to four years in prison. The cleric has strongly denied the charges, emphasizing that he has been seeking reforms in the kingdom through peaceful means. Anti-government protesters have been holding peaceful demonstrations across Bahrain since mid-February 2011, calling for an end to the al-Khalifa dynasty. Violence against the defenseless people escalated after a Saudi-led conglomerate of police, security and military forces from the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council (PGCC) member states - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar - were dispatched to the tiny Persian Gulf kingdom on March 2011, to help Manama crack down on peaceful protestors. So far, tens of protesters have been killed, hundreds have gone missing and thousands of others have been injured.

Johannesburg - President Jacob Zuma, in a statement on Tuesday, said government was looking at starting an alternative dispute resolution process to expedite all claims arising from the Marikana shootings. "A judge, assisted by experts, will be asked to lead this process in order to reinforce its independence," Zuma said. "Government will engage with the legal representatives of claimants, and encourage them to use this process. "To the extent that some do not lend their co-operation, or it is not possible to resolve claims through mediation, government will seek to do so through the court process." The president said government was still considering the recommendations made by the Farlam Commission of Inquiry, which investigated the deaths of 44 people during strike-related violence at Marikana in August 2012. Its final report was handed to Zuma on March 31, who then released it to the public on June 25. Zuma said, in the meantime, government had appointed Judge Cornelis Johannes Claasen to chair the inquiry into allegations of misconduct against National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega. Advocates Bernard Sakhile Khuzwayo and Anusha Rawjee would join Claassen on the board of inquiry. "Both processes are continuing, and are unaffected by what I have to announce today," Zuma said. "Government wishes to move forward to address the consequences of the incidents at Marikana. These incidents include not only the deaths and injuries of striking miners, but the deaths of other miners, security officials and police officers." Zuma said the Marikana massacre hurt the nation and the time had come for healing to begin.
Bernie Sanders is fast expanding his political staff, crafting a delegate strategy, and cultivating a vast volunteer corps and digital fundraising network that he believes can seriously challenge Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. Dismissed only a couple of months ago as a fringe candidate, the self-described democratic socialist senator from Vermont has proved in recent weeks that he is a contender to win the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. Now Sanders is plotting his path to the nomination in what he anticipates will be a long race for delegates.

The 27-year-old Sash was found dead Tuesday in his Oskaloosa, Iowa, home, about 3 1/2 years after he won a Super Bowl during his rookie season with the New York Giants. Foul play isn t suspected. The Iowa State Medical Examiner s office said an autopsy conducted Wednesday revealed "no acute trauma" or evidence that he was killed by external force. Sash starred for the Hawkeyes from 2007-10. As a junior in 2009, Sash picked off three Iowa State passes in a 35-3 win in Ames. A memorial service is set for Friday at the Oskaloosa Community Stadium at the Lacey Complex in Oskaloosa. A private family burial will follow. Bates Funeral Chapel in Oskaloosa is handling arrangements. 
ANKARA, Sept 15 (KUNA) -- Two police officers were killed, and other two injured in a blast carried out by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Hakkari province, southeastern Turkey on Tuesday, security sources said. The PKK members detonated an explosive device by a remote control at dawn, targeting a police vehicle on the Hakkari-Van Highway, the Anadolu News Agency quoted the sources as saying. It added that the wounded were taken to hospital, as an operation was launched in the area to nab the suspects involved in the incident. Earlier today, twelve Turkish soldiers were hurt when their military vehicle was caught up in a roadside bomb blast, also blamed on the PKK organization. The device, planted near the Mus-Diyarbakir/Kulp highway east of the country, was reportedly detonated while a military vehicle passed by today, according to Mus security directorate. (end) rs.msa

Portugal s president, An赤bal Cavaco Silva, has expressed his "great pride" in the Portuguese community of Newark and along the whole East Coast of the US, saying that the "flame of Portugal" is very much alive in that part of the world. The president was speaking at a meeting with the community on Tuesday night in the New Jersey town, which has the highest concentration of Portuguese in the US. "I have a great, great pride in the Portuguese community of Newark and in the Portuguese community on the east coast ... as a Portuguese for everything that the Portuguese and their descendants have done in this great country, our friend, that is the United States of America," Cavaco Silva said. In what was something of a farewell speech, just six months before his term as president is to end, Cavaco Silva highlighted the way that the Portuguese and their descendants in the US have earned respect over the years in fields form culture to science, education to politics. Addressing several hundred members of the community, the president recalled that when he took office almost a decade ago he pledged when travelling abroad always to meet Portuguese living locally. Tuesday night s gathering was one of the president s last engagements during a three-day visit to the US whose main purpose was his address to the seventieth General Assembly of the United Nations in New York. He is due to return to Portugal on Wednesday afternoon.
Chelsea defenders John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic are interesting Fenerbahce. Both were dropped for the Blues Champions League win over Maccabi Tel Aviv on Wednesday. Boss Jose Mourinho is yet to reassure either defender that they will be recalled for their Arsenal clash on Saturday. The Daily Star says Turkish giants Fenerbahce are interested in signing both men with a possible January swoop on the cards. Mourinho is understood to be already preparing a staggering fifth bid for Everton s John Stones when the transfer window reopens. Valencia defender Jose Luis Gaya has also been linked with a move to west London after Christmas. And with the Special One losing faith in his two veterans and eyeing new recruits, Terry and Ivanovic could be on their way before too long.

Liverpool s forgotten man Luis Alberto, currently on loan at Deportivo la Coruna, has just bagged this fantastic goal against Sporting Gijon, displaying some of the footballing intelligence and guile that drew him to Liverpool s attention. Following an unassuming loan spell at Malaga, it was assumed that Liverpool would cut their losses on the young Spaniard this summer, however, the decision to send him out on loan again seems to display either that Liverpool could not find a suitor, or that he is still rated by the staff at the club. If he flourishes, he may serve as a useful option for Brendan Rodgers fine footballing side. 
By Austin Ruse, C-Fam: A second source has come forward to confirm earlier Friday Fax reporting that the Obama administration intends to force Catholic and other Christian groups to accept LGBT applicants in hiring. The source, who insists upon anonymity, described a meeting held for department and agency heads at the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House where they were informed of the change in policy. An official from the Obama administration told the group that they would be required to add "sexual orientation and gender identity" to hiring guidelines for grant recipients, just the same as the Administration mandated for Federal contractors a year ago. The source reported to the Friday Fax that any organization receiving the grant could not discriminate based on 'sexual orientation and gender identity" in the hiring of an employee that worked on the program funded by the grant or in seeking subcontractors. Additionally, they could not discriminate based on 'sexual orientation and gender identity' when implementing the respective program." When the Friday Fax first reported this change last May the administration, through the National Security Council, denied the change in policy. Various faith-based groups who are Federal grant recipients also received denials from their administration contacts. Our source says the administration is lying when they deny such a change is in the works. Read here

Appointees working on school funding recommendations for Gov. Nathan Deal's Education Reform Commission have given preliminary approval to a fundamentally new way of reimbursing school districts for teacher pay. The new funding formula would encourage districts to abandon the teacher pay scale in place for decades. Officials say existing teachers would be grandfathered under the existing state pay scale and that only new teachers would be affected. But they acknowledge that nearly all local school districts would not have to honor that commitment. That's because all but two of Georgia's 180 districts have become, or have applied to become, "flexibility" systems. Charter systems and Strategic Waivers systems can ignore the state requirement to pay all teachers, including current teachers, on the pay scale. MAY 13, 2015 RIVERDALE 〞 Students eat lunch at the cafeteria at Riverdale High School. KENT D. JOHNSON /KDJOHNSON@AJC.COM So what are metro Atlanta districts' plans regarding teacher pay and grandfathering existing teachers? None clearly committed to preserving the pay scale for current teachers. Here's what Superintendent Luvenia Jackson of Clayton County Public Schools, which intends to become a strategic waivers system, says: "We have had no discussion regarding whether current teachers would be grandfathered under any scenario in which the pay structure is amended in our district."

Political instability in Northern Ireland is hurting the most vulnerable in society, church leaders have said. The heads of the Catholic and Protestant faiths in Ireland came together to urge politicians to take a "critical opportunity" to restore hope. Northern Ireland s five main political parties have begun talks in a bid to resolve the ongoing crisis at Stormont. The church leaders said a plan was needed to "to rebuild trust and advance the work of reconciliation". They added that the current instability at Stormont was bringing "further anxiety" to people "struggling to cope on low incomes". Threats Rev Brian Anderson, the head of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Church of Ireland Archbishop Richard Clarke, Catholic Archbishop Eamon Martin, Presbyterian Moderator Dr Ian McNie, and Dr Donald Watts, who presides over the Irish Council of Churches, signed the joint statement. They said political leaders had to draw up "effective measures to address poverty and socio-economic inequality". "Threats to the peace process are most keenly felt in those areas that benefited least from the progress of recent years," the statement added. "In addition to uncertainty about the impact of welfare reform, cuts to essential public services and the failure to agree a budget for future service provision have significant implications for the most vulnerable members of our society." Negotiations between the parties are due to continue on Tuesday, with unresolved finance and welfare issues featuring on the agenda.
AROUND 600 western Sydney council workers have walked off the job to protest the sacking of a young apprentice who claims to be the victim of workplace bullying. BLACKTOWN Council staff from multiple sectors began strike action about 12.30pm on Wednesday in solidarity with the apprentice, known only as Kieren. After being repeatedly harassed, Kieren became too scared to go to work, the United Services Union said. The council moved to fire him after questioning his days off. USU Metropolitan Manager Steve Donley said the council s subsequent investigation into the bullying claims had been unnecessarily long and had failed to interview 14 of the witnesses the apprentice put forward. "Blacktown Council does not have a bullying and harassment policy, so we ve advised from the start this matter needed to be investigated externally," said Mr Donley. "The Council could simply move the apprentice to another shift and monitor his performance, but instead he s been callously sacked," Mr Donley said. The USU called on the council s general manager Kerry Robinson to reinstate the apprentice, and implement a bullying policy "to ensure Blacktown Council is a safe place to work". Blacktown City Council warned residents the stoppages would affect garbage collection on Thursday. The council reassured the public it was doing everything within its power to resolve the issue. "We have lodged the matter with the NSW Industrial Relations Commission seeking a determination," it said. The workers will hold a meeting on Thursday morning to address how long the industrial action will continue.
During a live Q&A session at Facebook headquarters on Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg revealed the company is working on a "dislike" button. Zuckerberg acknowledged people have been asking for a dislike button for several years. This is the first time the company has admitted the button is in development. "People have asked about the dislike button for many years... and probably hundreds of people have asked about this. Today is a special day because today is the day that I actually get to say we are working on it, and are very close to shipping a test of it," Zuckerberg said Tuesday during the Q&A session. Zuckerberg was also clear that the button won t be designed to express negative thoughts, but rather "expressing empathy." The "dislike" button will not be for upvoting or downvoting comments and posts. "What they really want is the ability to express empathy. Not every moment is a good moment," Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg said the feature could launch "soon."

Lee says that from a technical perspective, the market was poised to break out. I had forecasted increased volatility since the beginning of the year and had written to our client base about it, she says. The volatility was not only historically below average, but it had also become range-bound, which is always the indication of a coming breakout. The chance of a breakout to the upside was lower than the chance for a breakout to the downside.

Attorneys who brought the Ohio lawsuit that led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage have asked a judge to approve their request for more than $1 million in legal fees and expenses. The attorneys said the request is reasonable because of the difficulty of the case and the importance of the issue. The attorneys also argued in a filing Friday for a court-ordered 50 percent enhancement of their $1.1 million request. The lawyers said such an enhancement is permissible because their work resulted in a landmark court decision and because the attorneys took on a difficult and unpopular case. The Cincinnati lawyers represented James Obergefell, who sued Ohio s health director for refusing to list him as the surviving spouse on his husband s death certificate.
KIEV, Sept. 23 - Skhidny Mining state enterprise (Zhovti Vody, Dnipropetrovsk region) plans to boost uranium concentrate production by 29.6% in 2015, to 1,200 tons, Director General Oleksandr Sorokin told reporters in Kiev on Tuesday. "This growth cannot be classified only as an achievement, as in 2014 well-known events caused problems with the delivery of explosives from east of Ukraine and some materials, we simple did not process a large volume of ore, or formed warehouse stocks, and now we're making up for leeway," he said.

Woa Welcome back Dudes & Dudettes.... If you haven t seen Finding Nemo you probably won t get the reference, but its turtley awesome....lol. Just like the Turtles on this card.... My friend and fellow demo Sarah Poulton made this gorgeous card HERE and I like it so much I had a hankering to do something on the same lines.. The backgrounds I have been creating using the Acrylic Block Watercolour Technique with Salt, (see previous post for method) had been intended for Christmas cards but looking at some of them they just screamed Ocean...... So I came up with this...... The background colours are Night of Navy and Island Indigo. I stamped the Turtles in the New Basic Black and coloured them using the Blender Pens and Old Olive and Always Artichoke, then I cut them out and covered them with Crystal Effects and left them to dry. Meanwhile I stamped the little shoal of fishes from the Stamp Set Sea Street on to the background in Versamark ink and sprinkled on Silver Embossing Power and heat embossed them... I added little specks of glitter using the New Fine Tip Glue Pen and Dazzling Diamonds Glitter. I popped the Turtles on to the card with Dimensionals.. I matted the background onto a piece of Whisper White which I had stamped Happy Birthday from the Stamp Set And Many More. I added two little crabs form the stamp set Sea Street. I hope you agree that its Turtley Awesome.... Thanks for stopping by... Happy Crafting X

As the Racine Raiders await word on when they will play their first game in the Midwest Football Tournament, Wilbert Kennedy s future has been decided. The Raiders Board of Directors has unanimously voted to bring back Kennedy for a third season as head coach. It was all but a formality considering Kennedy has gone 26-2 in two seasons as coach and led the Raiders to the 2014 National Football Events Summer/Fall National Championship. Kennedy joined the Raiders as a defensive tackle in 1989 and played with them through the 2009 season. He went on to become defensive line coach before replacing Gino Perfetto as head coach prior to the 2014 season. "It s really not about what I accomplished," said Kennedy, who turns 49 in November. "You re only as good as the people who are with you and that goes from the organization to the coaching staff to the players." The Raiders won their second straight Mid-States Football League championship Sept. 12 with a 34-26 victory over the Lincoln-Way Patriots.

The government is being accused of stealthily fixing up a flaw which has seen beneficiaries underpaid by millions of dollars over 18 years. Source: ONE News Since 1998 Work and Income has been starting people s benefit a day later than it should be, says benefit advocate Kay Brereton. The Social Security Appeal Authority had ruled that WINZ s computer system had been set up to grant a person s benefit from the day after their stand down ends, she said. However, the law required that the benefit be started the day the stand down ends, which was one day earlier. "What this means is that many thousands of people were short paid by one day. "While each underpayment is probably not large, it is to the people who have been short-changed." Ms Brereton said the Social Security (Extension of Youth Services and Remedial Matters) Amendment Bill, which is now going through parliament, contains an amendment which will retrospectively change the benefit start date, meaning the government won t have to make good the shortfall. "When the government became aware that they had been commencing benefits on the wrong date and short paying people did they take steps to rectify this error and commence paying correctly?" Ms Brereton asked. "No, they sought to change the law to legalise the defrauding of the poor."

Scientists claim that teenagers make the 'best liars', and the reason why might surprise you According to new scientific research, teenagers apparently make the 'best liars'. And why, you ask? Well, according to the findings teenagers are able to tell porkies quicker than their parents as they are able to 'think faster'. Scientists reckon that because teens' frontal lobe has not started deteriorating, they are able to think up excuses and fibs quicker than those older than them. The new research by Amsterdam University claims that more than half of teens (aged between 13 and 17 years old) tell as many as 5 lies a day. Teens apparently tell 5 lies a day Adults, on the other hand, tell just under 3 lies a day on average. The scientists behind the research said: "We found that lying proficiency improved during childhood, excelled in young adulthood, and worsened throughout adulthood. "Likewise, lying frequency increased in childhood, peaked in adolescence, and decreased during adulthood." Top reasons behind telling fibs included to 'make someone feel better and 'not getting into trouble'. Others choose to lie in order not to complicate things further, to 'prove a point' and even to 'save face'. What do you think of these new findings? Do you agree? Let us know on

The Nigerian Army on Friday said it has rescued 90 people including women and children, after dislodging Boko Haram members from two villages in Nigeria s restive north-east region. Acting Army Spokesman, Sani Usman, said in a statement on Saturday that troops rescued 23 men, 33 women and 34 children from the terrorists in the villages of Dissa and Balazala, which lie in the vicinity of the town of Gwoza in Borno State. Gwoza was where Boko Haram declared caliphate last year before the strategic town was recaptured by government troops in March. The military added that it had reopened a primary school in the town which had been shut down because of the insurgency and pledged to implement security measures to ensure the safety of pupils and teachers. The military also said it intercepted several Boko Haram fighters fleeing the battle zone disguised as internally displaced people. CHANNELSTV

An empty professional kitchen. I recently made note of the number of major restaurants that have been closing in Vermont. Now comes a story about the difficulty of many restaurants still in operation there that are having a hard time finding staff. The Burlington Free Press reports on the topic this way: Malcolm Dugan put toppings on pizza Tuesday evening at Waterworks Food and Drink, and described what he has learned in his first restaurant cooking job. When you eat in a restaurant, you typically think about people bringing you the food, said Dugan, an 18-year-old from Burlington. But there s more going on than you might imagine, he said. "A lot of preparation goes into what you get at a restaurant," Dugan said. "A lot more people are involved. There s a whole staff back here." But kitchen staffs aren t as full or deep as restaurant management would like. In Chittenden County and beyond, restaurants in Vermont are in need of cooks. "There s a crisis right now," said Richard Flies, acting president of the New England Culinary Institute. " ... From where we sit at NECI, the industry is going through a major change that will settle out. It s always depended on young people going into the industry. Young people will not tolerate the kind of hours and schedule that we used to." Go here for the rest of the story.

Mourinho: Blues rated at minus one The Blues found themselves trailing by two goals after Ayoze Perez and Georginio Wijnaldum both got on the score sheet in the opening 45 minutes at St James Park. However, substitutes Ramires and Willian were able to salvage a point for the defending Premier League champions in the final 11 minutes, although even the team s much-improved display in the second-half was not enough to eradicate the memory of the first. "I think in the first half from zero to 10 - minus one. That bad," Mourinho told Sky Sports. "In every aspect of the game, we were bad. There were too many poor individual performances. As a consequence of that, it s impossible for a team to be a good competitive team. "After 2-0, I moved the team and they responded very well to get a point which is not what you want - but it s not bad." He added: "In the second half, we played very well. Ramires and Willian moved the game, not because they scored the goals, but they moved the game. "We had more intensity, the midfield was pressing more, recovering more balls, much more dynamic, arriving in dangerous positions and that intensity, Newcastle could not cope with."
CyanogenMod has changed a lot over the years, but we re still seeing custom ROMs pumped out. The 12.1 release is the latest one to go stable. It offers users the ability to run Android 5.1.1, IMAP idle support, and SDK v1. CyanogenMod has also pushed out new stable builds for versions 11.0 and 12.0. These are security releases that address a number of security issues, including Stagefright . Get the update not for new features but to make sure that your phone or tablet is safe. Builds are only available for devices where maintainers have marked builds as Good to go. So if the gadget you re holding isn t yet on the list, you will have to be patient or opt to install one of the pre-release builds instead. Check the CyanogenMod Downloads page to be sure.
[Blog 1]: I really related to what this blogger had to say in that they identified the bias viewpoints on the advancements of technology. Most people picked a side in regards to what technology has to offer and if it is, in reality, helping us, so the subtle ignition of their two-sided post was beneficial. [Blog 2]: This blogger brings into play the future generations and their lifestyle being totally dependent on technology. When arguing the topic of such a broad basis, most people relate it to their own lifestyle and generation however we don t really look into the lifestyle of someone born into it. Imagine being born holding an iphone, and being so classically conditioned and maybe even physically adapted to already knowing how to use it. [Blog 3]: This last blogger brings up the commonalities in their posts upon going back and rereading them. In my opinion I thought it was an interesting point because most individuals would assume commonality is bad however I think it is good. It is good to be unique but for example in social media, I try to have interesting content with an overall general theme, almost like a photo filter that everything commonly falls into. That in a sense ties the material together while still keeping readers and viewers intreged.
As posted on Interactive book apps 每 10 of the best For both novelesque stories and non-fiction, iOS and Android apps are trying innovative ways to tell stories In the early days of Apple's iPad, there was a gallon of hype around the potential for interactive book apps. When many of the early, expensive-to-develop examples flopped on the App Store, the hype ebbed away. Even so, a number of developers, publishers and authors have continued plugging away at the idea, with the results often standing proud as works of fiction or non-fiction, regardless of the way they're delivered.

Rafael Nadal s miserable year continued as the 14-time major champion threw away a two-set lead to lose to Italy s Fabio Fognini at the US Open. Nadal outplayed Fognini for over an hour under the lights of Arthur Ashe Stadium but the Italian found a different gear as he came storming back to win 3-6 4-6 6-4 6-3 6-4. Rafael Nadal, pictured, lost to Italian Fabio Fognini in the US Open third round It means Nadal has only managed to reach two quarter-finals at grand slams this year and ends the season without a major title for the first time since 2004. The Spaniard had been bullish about a return to form in the build-up to Flushing Meadows, insisting criticism had been exaggerated for a player still ranked number eight in the world. Fognini, however, exposed his opponent s weaknesses with devastating efficiency, unleashing 70 winners - 34 of them forehands - during an exhilarating contest which lasted three hours and 46 minutes. The match came to a climax in the fifth set as the pair exchanged seven consecutive breaks of serve and a series of thrilling points, which had the remaining crowd applauding on their feet. Leading 5-4, Fognini finally held serve to seal victory and the world number 30 will now face Spain s Feliciano Lopez for a place in the quarter-finals. Copyright PA Sport 2015, All Rights Reserved
Story highlights Turkish troops haven t entered Iraq since a ceasefire was signed in 2013 with Kurds PKK has been targeted by airstrikes, and Turkish news agency says the rebels have killed security forces Two sides have been in conflict for decades It has been more than two years since a Turkish ground incursion into Iraq, its southeastern neighbor. The Turkish military has conducted airstrikes in recent months against suspected targets of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in the mountains of northern Iraq. They have also arrested PKK members in Turkey. The Kurdistan Worker s Party, which seeks an independent state in Turkey, has been in an armed struggle with Turkey for decades and has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The conflict has killed 45,000 people since 1984. Turkey s semi-official Anadolu news agency quoted Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as saying: "If the people in the region stand against the terrorist organization ... this issue will be quickly solved." Anadolu reported that more than 100 Turkish security forces -- including 13 police officers who died Tuesday -- have been killed since July. The PKK maintains some camps in the rugged border area of northern Iraq, an autonomous region not controlled of the central government in Baghdad where many Kurds from Turkey have relocated. The region is governed by the Kurdistan Regional government. In July, the PKK issued a statement declaring a 2013 ceasefire with Turkey to be over, according to pro-PKK Firat News Agency. Other Kurdish fighters have been battling ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

Recent builds of Google Chrome comes with a super useful flag option named Tab Discarding. It basically discard tabs that have not been accessed in a while. The tab still exists in the browser but the content is no longer accessing your system's resources. The tab is reloaded as soon as you click on it removing the need to continuously closing tabs you are not using but might need in near future. There is one major problem with this of course＃ It might cause issues on tabs which have dynamic content or you are working on a draft in it as the refresh might result in data loss. I have personally not experienced this as the tabs that are discarded are quite old and I am usually not working on them actively. The flag can be accessed by entering this URL in Chrome's omnibox: I recently upgraded by RAM from 8GB to 16GB because Chrome had become painful to use on 8GB RAM. But due to some conflicts resulting in BSODs, I had to go back to 8GB RAM configuration on my PC. This flag option has pretty much removed the need to double my system's RAM. Though I do miss not having access to 16GB RAM in Windows 1

If you see something strange in the city next week, be alert not alarmed. It s probably just the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art s ACCA in the City program. For its performance, Training Ground, Tel Aviv-based group Public Movement has recruited performers for what member Hagar Ophir calls a "training for confrontation" at City Square every day from 5pm. "Which is interesting, as it s not really a square and half of it s not public any more but it belongs to private owners," Ophir says. "You cannot really gather there but we are trying to have a drill of confrontation, bodies that can again become political bodies through this conflict." Ophir also gives a talk on Thursday, September 24 titled There Will Be No Kangaroos in Melbourne City, based on the "preconceptions of someone who comes from one colony to another colony". The ACCA in the City program also features performances by Lithuanian Egle Budvytyte and Melbourne artist Kate Daw. The program runs from September 21-27.
Allegheny Technologies (ATI) announced that it has closed on the previously announced asset-based lending revolving credit facility that replaces its $400 million revolving credit facility. The five-year $400 million ABL facility is collateralized by the accounts receivable and inventory of ATI's domestic operations. According to a related 8-K filing , ATI entered into the facility with a lender group led by PNC Bank as agent and PNC Capital Markets as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner. The applicable interest rate for borrowings under the revolver includes spreads that range between 1.25% and 1.75% for LIBOR-based borrowings and 0.25% and 0.75% for base rate borrowings. ATI said, compared to its previous revolving credit facility, the ABL facility contains no leverage or interest coverage ratios, and the borrowing costs are expected to be lower. There is no impact on ATI's outstanding bonds as a result of replacing the previous facility with the ABL facility. "The new ABL facility helps secure our solid liquidity position," said Pat DeCourcy, senior vice president, finance and CFO. "We are pleased to have received strong support on the new facility from our banking group."

A Met Police chief is asking Bexley residents to protect their homes - during a time when burglaries normally increase across the borough. Borough commander Chief Supt Jeff Boothe issued the warning because of the typical increase in burglaries in late September and October 每 thought to be connected to longer autumn nights. Although burglaries have reduced 32 per cent across Bexley in the past year, local people should be on their guard and remember that a third of London burglaries have no signs of forced entry. Bexley borough commander Chief Supt Jeff Boothe Residents should ensure windows and doors are properly locked ; keep valuables out of reach from windows; use timer light switches; lock side gates; and avoid leaving packaging for new, expensive items outside. Bexley police officers involved in Operation Bumblebee will be targetting evasive burglary suspects, and patrolling burglary hot spots. Chief Supt Boothe said: "Burglary is a crime that has a huge emotional and long-lasting impact on the victim. TODAY S TOP STORIES: "I'm urging residents to assist us by thinking about home security and making sure they re not leaving themselves vulnerable to burglars. Share article "We'll carry on targeting known thieves that are operating in the area, but the public can also play a big part in making Bexley a hostile place for thieves and burglars."

Microsoft s Xbox may not be receiving ports of key Sega arcade titles OutRun 2 and Virtua Cop 3 after all, with the company still unsure about demand for the titles on the Xbox. The post appeared first on Digital＃ It had been widely assumed that Xbox versions of the games would appear in time since they were developed for the Xbox-based Chihiro arcade machines 每 which should have made porting them to the home console extremely easy. However, Sega has apparently not made up its mind either way on the issue 每 with AM2 producer Makoto Osaki telling Japanese publication Dorimag this week that a decision will be reached based on consumer demand for the titles. Osaki-san cited difficulties with porting both games to home platforms, mentioning that Virtua Cop 3 would suffer due to the requirement for a light gun peripheral, while Sega has concerns over the tendency for players to rent racing games rather than buying them. Dorimag reports that a decision on whether the games will be ported to consoles, or remain arcade-only, will be made in the coming weeks. If no Xbox port is forthcoming, this will be a blow to Microsoft, which i＃
HOLDEN has announced it will keep more than 100 design and development jobs in Australia after manufacturing moves overseas in 2017. Managing director Mark Bernhard said an 18-person crew would also be established in the country as part of General Motors design team. The announcement means more than 300 Holden staff will still be working in Australia after the 2017 manufacturing shutdown. This came as Holden yesterday revealed the final Australian manufactured Commodore, the VFII, 37 years after the original 1978 VB sedan was launched. The model is the fastest, most powerful and most advanced Commodore, with a 304kW 6.2-litre LS3 V8, plus styling changes and revised specification over the current model. It was launched at the brand s headquarters in Port Melbourne against a backdrop of Commodores from every series since 1978, concept models and race cars. The new VFII will be the last Commodore manufactured in Australia before the factory closes in late 2017. The Commodore name will live on beyond this on an as-yet unknown imported model from General Motors.

ROXANA -- Pana kept chugging away through the air. They didn t light up the scoreboard, but Roxana never found a way to stop the Panthers, either. A year after Pana suffered a two-point loss, one that kept the Panthers from making the playoffs, they dominated the night with a 27-6 win. Rhett Zahradka had one of the best nights of his career, going 14-for-18 passing for 301 yards and two touchdowns. "This was a big win for our program and for our seniors," Pana coach Al Stupek said. "Obviously, there are some statistics that jump out, like the 300 yards in passing for Rhett. We have got awesome people that can do something with the ball when they get it. But if you don t have a good line, you won t be able to move the ball." A week after the running game crushed Staunton, it was inconsistent against Roxana. "Our run game was a little funny," Stupek said. "We had three or four snaps that went over Rhett s head -- one of them was a 21-yard loss." Roxana spoiled the shutout by scoring in the fourth quarter, bringing Pana s total points allowed for the season to six. "The defense was hungry and stingy," Stupek said. "They had a history of that in the past. "The kids are really playing hard."

Recent explorations in Iran have resulted in the discovery of more natural uranium reserves, the Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali-Akbar Salehi, announced in Tehran＃ Tehran: Recent explorations in Iran have resulted in the discovery of more natural uranium reserves, the Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali-Akbar Salehi, announced in Tehran today. Over 63 per cent of Iran s geography has been explored for uranium reserves and the rest will be surveyed in the next four years, ,Mr Salehi said, Xinhua reported, citing the official IRNA news agency. "I cannot talk about the level of the country s uranium reserves. The important thing is before the aerial survey, we were not much hopeful about uranium ores, but the recent explorations have made us hopeful about the deposits," he said. Presently, Iran is extracting uranium from Saghand in Yazd mines in central Iran, and the mines of Ardakan are also scheduled for exploitation in near future, he said. The announcement by Iran s atomic chief came before the arrival of experts of the United Nations nuclear watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency here for talks on＃

The oldest signs of heavy metal pollution caused by human activity, dating from the early Stone Age, have been found in caves in Spain and Gibraltar, officials said Monday. The findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports, indicate prehistoric humans inhabited caves with high heavy metal levels caused from fires, fumes and ashes which could have played a role in their tolerance of environmental pollution. The highest levels of heavy metals -- copper, lead, nickel and zinc -- were found in Gorham s Cave in Gibraltar, a tiny British territory on Spain s southern tip, where well preserved Neanderthal hearths have been found.

[Breaking news update, published at 11:17 a.m. ET] A proposed $6.4 million settlement in the death of Freddie Gray would "resolve all civil claims related to the city of Baltimore, the Baltimore Police Department, individual Baltimore police officers, and any other persons or institutions who might be deemed responsible for the death of Mr. Gray," the city said in a news release Tuesday. The city s law department will submit the proposal to the city s Board of Estimates on Wednesday, the city said.

InventHelp Past News Releases RSS PITTSBURGH, PA (PRWEB) September 05, 2015 "We noticed that when waves washed over the deck of our boat, it got everything wet - our floor, our gear, our fellow passengers," said one of two inventors from Edgewater, Fla. "Once things began rusting, we realized that we needed to come up with a solution to this problem." They created a prototype for the patent-pending PONTOON BOAT WAVE SHIELD to keep moisture out of the boat during normal operation. It intercepts waves, preventing water from entering the enclosed deck area. The accessory also serves as a floor mat when entering the boat from the beach or shore line. The guard preserves boat and prolongs its useful life. It reduces the need to perform normal cleaning. Furthermore, the invention is usable on any pontoon boat. The original design was submitted to the Orlando office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.

We are still easing into the 7th grade this week. Students are getting used to the lockers, the hallways, their teachers, and each other. I m getting organized, expressing my expectations, trying to learn the names of 100 young people. I think it s safe to say that we re all off to a good start. This week we will be taking the ELA pretest on Tuesday and Wednesday. It s not terribly exciting, but we have to get it done. Thursday I will be attempting to spread the joys and benefits of reading. And on Friday we will be heading down to "check out" the library, and after orientation, students will be allowed to borrow a book. Although they are allowed to (and should) get a different book if they don t like it, ideally, it would be great if students are able get a book they re happy with so that they can complete their AR quiz on time.

Rancho Palos Verdes is about 25 miles (40 km) from Catalina Island. The Coast Guard will also fly over the area to search for the whale, Milbury said.

A man has been charged with murder following a stabbing at a central Queensland boarding house earlier this month. The 33-year-old faces one count of murder and one count of attempted murder after allegedly stabbing two other men at the Rockhampton house on September 15. One of the injured men, aged 32, died the following day from his injuries. The second alleged victim, aged 33, received wounds to his chest and abdomen but survived the incident. The alleged attacker was initially charged with two counts of grievous bodily harm but will face Rockhampton Magistrates Court later on Thursday on the upgraded charges.
Protesters who claim they were threatened with rape and drowning on a Victorian military base have launched a legal bid to get the names of Defence Force officers. Sam Quinlan, Greg Rolles and David Sprigg swam to the Swan Island military base from Queenscliff in October 2014 to protest Australia s involvement in foreign wars. They say they were thrown to the ground and dragged, had bags put over their heads and were stripped naked. One was allegedly threatened with rape and another with drowning. Maurice Blackburn lawyer Jacob Varghese said the Australian Defence Force had refused to release the names of the officers involved so they could be sued. "These men are peaceful protesters who were prepared to accept the lawful consequences of their actions but they did not deserve this violent assault on their dignity," Mr Varghese said on Tuesday. "The protesters experienced brutal, degrading and humiliating treatment at the hands of Defence Force personnel." In October last year, Army chief Lieutenant General David Morrison said the allegations would be taken seriously and investigated. The protest at Swan Island was a regular event staged by the Swan Island peace group, objecting to the US alliance and Australian involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Australian Defence Force has been contacted for comment.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska 〞 Authorities say three people are dead after a floatplane belonging to a fishing lodge crashed with 10 people on board in southwest Alaska. Alaska State Troopers say the three were from outside the state. The agency says injured passengers are being flown to Anchorage hospitals following the crash Tuesday near the small community of Iliamna (ill-ee-AHM -nuh). It s unclear how many people are hurt. Local residents say the plane belongs to the Rainbow King Lodge. Calls to the business went unanswered. Rescue personnel initially took injured passengers to the Iliamna clinic. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer says the plane crashed on takeoff at Eastwind Lake, 1 mile north of Iliamna. He says the aircraft was a De Havilland DHC-3 Turbine Otter on floats, and the cause of the crash is not yet known. Iliamna is about 175 miles southwest of Anchorage.

ROME -- Roma playmaker Miralem Pjanic will likely miss the Giallorossi s Champions League opener against Barcelona due to a right calf strain. Pjanic was injured while playing for Bosnia in a 3-0 win over Andorra on Sunday in a European Championship qualifier. His absence would be a setback for the Italian club after the midfielder s strong start to the season. Roma says tests Tuesday revealed a first-degree strain and Pjanic s condition will be assessed over the coming days. Pjanic will miss Saturday s Serie A match at Frosinone. Roma then hosts defending champion Barcelona at the Stadio Olimpico next week. Pjanic scored with a curling free kick in Roma s 2-1 win over Juventus last month. Roma s 38-year-old captain Francesco Totti, who is yet to play this season, will likely replace Pjanic against Frosinone.
Ernest Moniz, US Energy Secretary The Energy Secretary for the United States, Ernest Moniz, thinks that the costs of producing solar and wind energy have fallen so low that they would be competitive with oil and gas even without the subsidies they currently receive from the government. Moniz, who was trained as a nuclear physicist, explained to reporters that while the Obama administration is still in favor of the current push to extend renewable energy tax credits in Congress, there really is no need for them anymore. Moniz's belief comes from very real statistics that show the solar and wind market gaining momentum. At the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas, he backed up his ideas by citing rooftop solar panels, which could become as cheap as 6 cents per kilowatt hour in the near future. Wind energy is also falling in price, and electricity from wind farms is now cost-competitive with oil and gas. The Wind Technologies Market Report from August 10 also demonstrates that wind energy is becoming extremely cheap, dropping nearly 5 cents per kilowatt hour in 2014. The report attributes this drop to "lower wind turbine price and installed project costs, along with improvements in expected [production capacity]". Of course, the oil and gas industry continued to receive subsidies from the government long after fossil fuel extraction became cheap, easy and nearly risk-free. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect solar and wind to get the same chance by way of federal assistance. Image (c) US Government

The decision was taken through a resolution passed by the general body of the corporation on Friday to ban the sale of meat and closure of abattoirs during Paryushan - fasting observed by the Jain community - from September 11-18. "The general body had passed the resolution suo-moto to ban the sale of meat and closure of meat shops during the period of fast by Jains," MBMC Commissioner Achyut Hange said. As per the resolution, slaughter of animals will not be allowed under the Mira Bhayander limits between September 11 and 28. A meeting has been called to discuss the matter with all stakeholders on Monday, the officer, said, adding police will also attend the meeting.

Updated: 09/29/2015 12:50 PM | Created: 09/29/2015 8:56 AM By: KOB.com Web Staff Supporters of Planned Parenthood gathered at the University of New Mexico campus Tuesday to call for the government to maintain funding of the organization. Big developments are expected today in the battle over funding since controversial videos involving the group became public. Those videos, which were shot without the knowledge of Planned Parenthood, show officials talking about how tissue from aborted fetuses gets used for research. The GOP has used backlash from the videos to launch an effort to pull Planned Parenthood funding. Today in Washington, the group s president went before a House committee of Congress to testify and answer questions about their work. She said the videos were edited and misleading. "The latest smear campaign is based on efforts by our opponents to entrap our doctors and clinicians into breaking the law, and once again our opponents failed," president Cecile Richards said. Monday night, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stripped a provision from the budget that would cancel Planned Parenthood funding in exchange for keeping the government open. The bill will keep the government operating through Dec. 11 if it passes. KOB welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the rules of conduct set forth in our Terms of Use .

PORTLAND, OR , Sept. 10, 2015 (RISI) - Canfor Corporation announced the permanent closure of its sawmill in Canal Flats, British Columbia, which has a two-shift production capacity of 180 million board feet. The Company anticipates the mill will cease operations on November 9, 2015. All employees impacted by the closure will be offered opportunities to transfer to other divisions of the Company. "A lack of economically available fiber supply for our Canal Flats operation, combined with depressed market conditions in the oil and gas and lumber markets that it serves, have brought operating losses we can no longer sustain," said Canfor President and CEO Don Kayne. "We recognize this decision will be difficult for our employees and the community of Canal Flats, and we are committed to doing what we can to ease that transition."

TOKYO〞Japan's industrial output unexpectedly fell, raising concern that the economy may have fallen back into its second recession since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took government.The slump in production is likely to intensify debate on the need for Abe's administration to increase spending and for the central bank to boost its already unprecedented monetary stimulus.Falling prices, weak consumer spending and a slowdown in key export market China are weighing on Japanese businesses, which are holding back investment and building up inventories in warehouses."Risks of a contraction are increasing," said Toru Suehiro, an economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. "Production is pretty weak, led by a slowdown in China and poor domestic consumer spending. There is no sign for output to pick up quickly."Production dropped 0.5 in Au ...

Dumaguete City (CNN Philippines) 〞 Interior Secretary Manuel "Mar" Roxas II urged the people of Negros Oriental to stay true to the cause of Daang Matuwid, the Aquino administration s good governance policy. Roxas was in Dumaguete City on Friday (September 4), a day before the launch of the Partido NegORense. The next day he he sent Rep. Mel Sarmiento, the Liberal Party s Secretary General, to read his message during the launching. In his message, Roxas urged Partido NegOrEnse members, headed by Gov. Roel Ragay Degamo, "to stay true to the noble cause of serving the people, to stay true to the local party's goals of defending the dreams and aspirations of every NegOrEnse and every Filipino." He said the greater challenge of Daang Matuwid was yet to come and the benefit of the transformation would be experienced by the next generation. He said elections would happen in less than a year and people would be asked to make decisions that would determine the success of Daang Matuwid. Earlier, Degamo said he wasn t a Liberal Party member but he and his party would support Roxas in his bid for the presidency.
The Fed will announce the outcome of its policy meeting on an interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET, followed by a press conference by Chair Janet Yellen. This morning U.S. stock index futures were lower, ahead of the nail-biting decision. The dollar was under mild pressure mostly from the euro after weak U.S. inflation data had underscored one of the arguments for the Fed to hold fire, while oil and some other key commodities gave back some of their recent gains. Futures pricing suggests an only 1 in 4 chance that it will pull the trigger. The latest poll by Reuters on Wednesday also showed the majority of economists now expect no hike, although it remains an extremely close call. Summarized by Reblog Share Tweet Send
On the eve of Teachers Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is holding a video-conferencing session with 800 students and 60 teachers from various schools in New Delhi. Here are Modi s quotes ahead of Teachers Day 1. Students are an image of teachers 2. Mother gives birth to a child, teacher gives life 3. There will hardly be anyone in the world who will not admit the role of their mother and teacher in their life. 4. What teachers say to us, we will remember for the rest of our lives. 5. I bow to all the teachers. It is the teachers who make the generations. 6. If a teacher does not invest in his students, he is incomplete. 7. A true teacher never retires 8. Life is not shaped by one person. It s a continuous process to remain receptive. Always learn from everything. 9. We have to see that our kids do not become robots. They should appreciate arts. Without arts, life is robotic. 10. I think teachers should write their memoirs. This will reflect their involvement in the lives of several students.
Cost, fear of suboptimal results, and uncertainty over choosing a provider are the key concerns that may deter prospective patients from receiving cosmetic treatments, new findings from the 2015 American Society for Dermatologic Surgery Consumer Survey on Cosmetic Dermatologic Procedures show. In response to the findings, ASDS President George J. Hruza, MD, MBA said those concerns can be successfully resolved. That contention is backed by high satisfaction rates expressed by those who have procedures. Several procedures frequently performed by ASDS members〞including wrinkle-relaxing injections, soft-tissue fillers and laser/light-based procedures to improve skin tone〞earned patient satisfaction ratings of 84 percent or higher. This marks the third straight year that survey respondents listed these three factors as the top reasons to hold off on pursuing a cosmetic procedure. While acknowledging cost is always important to consumers, Dr. Hruza said patients receive tremendous value from cosmetic procedures performed by ASDS members considering their advanced level of training and expertise.

Coca-Cola says it will not renew its sponsorship of a professional group for dietitians, bringing to a halt one of the many outreach efforts on health by the world s biggest soda maker. The Atlanta-based company said its decision was driven by its "budget realities." It said it will also not renew current contracts with the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Cardiology when they end this year. The groups were informed of the decision earlier this summer, the company said Tuesday. The decision not to renew contracts with the various groups also comes as Coca-Cola has come under fire for its funding of programs and partnerships on health matters.
Key parties with a stake in Dunedin s waterfront are preparing to talk about the future. The Dunedin City Council, Otago Regional Council and Port Otago have all signalled a willingness to discuss a more co-ordinated approach to the development of Dunedin s waterfront. The push came after Cr Jinty MacTavish, chairwoman of the DCC s community and environment committee, studied Wellington s approach to its waterfront during a recent visit. The capital had done a really beautiful job , and the key was the creation of a cohesive body to co-ordinate development, she believed. Dunedin Mayor Dave Cull backed the idea, saying the approaches adopted in Wellington and Auckland could be considered for Dunedin. I don t see why we can t have a role like that too. ORC chairman Stephen Woodhead said the councils already worked together on an as-needs basis , but he would be happy to join any working group considering the waterfront s future. He doubted a dedicated agency was needed, though, saying the scale of the opportunities in Dunedin cannot be compared with the likes of Auckland . Port Otago chief executive Geoff Plunket said he would also be happy to discuss any proposal with the DCC, although the company cannot really form a view without more information.

Russia s state nuclear energy agency Rosatom and Nuclebras Equipamentos Pesados S.A. (NUCLEP), Brazil s leading nuclear company providing services in heavy engineering, have signed the Memorandum of Understanding during the 7th session of the Intergovernmental Russian-Brazilian High Level Commission, the Russian energy company said in a statement. The memorandum s subject is the development of partnership between the parties not only in the nuclear power and electricity industry, such as cooperation in possible construction of NPP in Brazil, but also cooperation in a wide range of other areas, such as power-plant engineering, thermal power industry, petrochemical industry, and shipbuilding, the statement says. The memorandum aims at potential implementation of joint projects not only in Brazil, but also in other Latin American countries. Implementation of the memorandum will be held with support from Rosatom Am谷rica Latina, Rosatom s subsidiary. Russian-Brazilian interaction in the nuclear energy is regulated by the agreement between the government of the Russian Federation and the government of the Federal Republic of Brazil on cooperation in peaceful use of nuclear energy dated September 15, 1994. On July 21, 2009, Brazil and Russia signed the Memorandum of Understanding. In June 2015, Rosatom International Network opened Rosatom s office in Rio-de-Janeiro, Rosatom Am谷rica Latina. The office is to be Rosatom s headquarters in Latin America.

Some Irish shoppers had a Haka sprung on them recently, before Shane Horgan asked them to copy the war dance for a chance to win a trip to the Rugby world Cup. In a new ad for Heineken, the former Ireland and Leinster player spoke to some unsuspecting shoppers as a trio of Maoris appeared before them in the aisles. Horgan then invited them to perform their own version of the traditional war dance, with hilarious results. Fair play to everyone who got stuck in with a war dance of their own. [embedded content] A particular shout out to the older lady who gave it her best shot despite walking with a crutch; in our opinion very hard done by not to make the final two.

AT&T also expects to report positive U.S. net subscriber additions for the recently acquired satellite TV provider DirecTV, it said in a regulatory filing. AT&T, which reported 2.1 million net wireless additions in the second quarter, said in August that it expected revenue, earnings and free cash flow to grow through 2018 following its purchase of DirecTV and wireless expansion in Mexico. AT&T also said it would change the methodology DirecTV used to count its commercial subscribers to conform to its practices, which will reduce DirecTV s total subscriber count by 918,600 at the close of the deal in July.
A jury has failed to reach a unanimous verdict in the case of a man accused of killing his Gold Coast housemate in a gruesome stabbing. Paul Gathercole had pleaded not guilty to the murder of Robbie Joseph Charles at Mermaid Beach on February 1, 2014. The pair had lived together for about a year when the fatal stabbing took place. That night they had been out to a darts club function and then the Nobby s Beach Surf Life Saving Club, with Mr Charles girlfriend Vanessa Heath. Things took a fatal turn when the trio returned home, with Ms Heath eventually finding her boyfriend of four years dying in the driveway with his intestines falling out a huge wound. During the trial, the crown prosecutor argued Gathercole stabbed his friend with the intention of killing him, or at the very least, causing him grievous bodily harm. Justice Jean Dalton discharged the jury on Wednesday afternoon after they gave her a note saying they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. She adjourned the case to a callover court and said she would ask the list manager to prioritise the case. Gathercole was remanded in custody.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Hitachi on Monday over alleged corrupt payments made to South Africa's ruling ANC party linked to a $2 billion power plant deal. The SEC said the Japanese company made "improper payments" linked to the deal that were "inaccurately recorded" under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hitachi The charges related to the company's late-2000s sale of a 25 percent stake in a South African subsidiary to a front company of the African National Congress, asHitachi The deal, which became a large scandal in South Africa in 2010, "gave the front company and the ANC the ability to share in the profits from any power station contracts that Hitachi Hitachi Under FCPA rules, US regulators can pursue such charges against a foreign company like Hitachi "Hitachi "Hitachi Under public pressure, in 2014 Hitachi
Posted Thursday, September 3rd 2015 @ 10am by Mark Townsend ( Yahoo! ) The Baltimore Orioles were in a season-altering slump coming in to Wednesday s game against the Tampa Bay Rays . After losing 12 out of 13, the defending American League East champions have all but officially removed themselves from playoffs contention. It s a disappointing reality to be sure, especially considering there were realistic expectations that they could repeat in a wide open division. With that in mind, it would be difficult to blame fans in Baltimore if they were feeling apathetic. In some cases, it might even render them sluggish or outright bored, to the point that they d fall asleep in the bleachers at Orioles Park at Camden Yards. At least that appeared to be the case for one fan during Wednesday s game. He was spotted sprawled out over several seats in right-center during the 11th inning, but he received the ultimate wake-up call from Chris Davis . Read more from

REUTERS: Twice Giro d Italia winner Ivan Basso, who withdrew from this year s Tour de France after revealing he had testicular cancer, has been given the all-clear following treatment, his Tinkoff-Saxo team has said. The 37-year-old Italian felt pain in his left testicle after crashing in the fifth stage of the Tour and tests later showed he had a small tumour. Basso had surgery in Milan. Tinkoff-Saxo rider Ivan Basso of Italy cycles during the 13.8 km (8.57 miles) individual time-trial first stage of the 102nd Tour de France cycling race in Utrecht, Netherlands, July 4, 2015. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier "Fabulous news on @ivanbasso! Results from final controls show no need for extra treatment. The dark period that started at @letour is over," Tinkoff-Saxo posted on Twitter. Basso finished third and second overall in the 2004 and 2005 Tour de France but has won the Giro - his only grand tour titles - thanks to impressive climbing performances. His career, however, was stained with a two-year ban for his implication in the Operation Puerto blood-doping scandal. Basso admitted to "attempted doping" in 2007 and was hit by a backdated suspension. He won the Giro in 2010, less than two years after his comeback, to add to his 2006 success.

Local & State LEE COUNTY, Fla. 每 In early June Lee County Sheriff's Patrol K9 Kilo, was working to apprehend a suspect when he was chocked, attacked and knocked out by the criminal. Kilo was not wearing a protective vest, however that all changed Thursday morning. Thanks to a generous donation from the Retired Law Enforcement Association, the sheriff's office received eight ballistic protective vests, custom fitted for each patrol dog, including Kilo. All Lee County Sheriff's Patrol K9's now have their own fitted and protective vest. Protective vests for law enforcement K9's start at $1,500, a savings the county can now put toward other projects. Since the vests are custom fitted for each dog and over time they wear out, donations like the one made Thursday morning are critical to helping keep these patrol K9's safe. The Lee County Sheriff's Office has more than 25 active K9's, 13 of them work on patrol serving Lee County every day.

Re: How long for an annual? by wsmempson Thu Sep 10, 2015 5:12 pm For a Piper Archer, with no show-stopping faults or esoteric issues that come to light during the annual, 10 days should cover it comfortably. There is an irritating working trait amongst some outfits where during the annual, one fault is found and parts ordered and all other work stops until said parts arrive. Then, at that point work continues and another fault is found, and all work stops again until more parts arrive. Working this way, it s not uncommon for an annual to take months, and the only remedy is not to use outfits that work like that.
CNS Canada 〞 Manitoba winter wheat seeding is underway, but farmers are facing some complications in areas where other crops aren't out of the ground yet. Winter wheat seeding traditionally takes place from Aug. 15 to Sept. 15. "But it's been a bit tricky this year," said Jake Davidson, executive director at Winter Cereals Canada. Canola, a major stubble source for winter wheat, has been coming off later due to frost earlier in the year and producer reseeding. Where canola is ready to come off the fields, wet weather has left producers unable to get on the fields, Davidson said. "I was hoping on increased acreage. But it might not work out; (in) different areas it's just a matter of having the stubble crop," he said. This year's winter wheat production in Manitoba reached 381,000 tonnes, fewer than last year's 470,800. Regardless, Davidson said, producers are still happy. "Low fusarium; high protein; reasonable yields for the year." 〞 Jade Markus writes for Commodity News Service Canada, a Winnipeg company specializing in grain and commodity market reporting.

SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc introduced the iPad Pro, a larger tablet device aimed at the enterprise market on Wednesday as it struggles with slumping sales of standard iPads. Apple said the new iPad Pro s screens will measure 12.9 inches diagonally and allows for a full size software keyboard. The company has been trying to push the iPad into the corporate market and analysts say a gadget with a bigger screen may appeal to some professionals seeking to swap out their laptops for tablets.

EVERSON, Wash. 每 Last weekend's stormy weather is likely to blame for two more deaths near Bellingham. Police said a family member discovered an elderly couple dead inside their home on Central Road late Wednesday. Officials believe carbon monoxide from a power generator likely killed them, saying the device was likely placed too close to an open cellar door. "The door was partially ajar and it allowed we believe the carbon monoxide gasses to get into the residence," said Whatcom County Sheriff Bill Elfo. The county medical examiner identified the victims as 82-year-old Anthony and 71-year-old Marilyn Vermeulen of Everson, WA. The strong windstorm last weekend tossed limbs and trees onto roadways all over western Washington, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people. Police said the storms knocked out power to the Vermeulen's home, too. Investigators did not locate carbon monoxide detectors inside their home. Police say this case is a tragic reminder for anyone who might use a generator when powerful storms knock out power lines. "Keep the generator away from the house and as well have a carbon monoxide detector," said Elfo.
PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies plan to move to a six-man rotation in the near future, which is why they have not announced a starter for Wednesday night s series finale against the Braves at Citizens Bank Park. The smart bet is right-hander David Buchanan, whom the Phillies recalled from Triple-A Lehigh Valley on Monday. It might make more sense to give Buchanan a look over the remainder of the season, considering he is expected to remain in the organization next year. Right-hander Jerome Williams is an option for Wednesday, but he can become a free agent and is unlikely to return. The Phillies on Monday also announced they recalled right-handed reliever Nefi Ogando and left-hander Ken Roberts. Both will help an overworked bullpen. Todd Zolecki is a reporter for MLB.com.

Plans to improve transport links in Burntwood have been unveiled by Lichfield District Council. A new bus interchange is outlined in a new Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) being put forward by Lichfield District Council. The document 每 which will be discussed at a scrutiny meeting next week 每 also suggests the local authority would like to see a rail station in Burntwood if the Walsall to Lichfield line was reopened. The report adds: "The Burntwood Local Transport Package has been drawn up to help rejuvenate Burntwood by supporting an enhanced town centre, employment growth at Burntwood Business Park and housing growth east of the bypass. "These measures include bus access improvements and increased service frequency, improved sustainable transport links across the urban area and into Chasewater, a new bus interchange facility and public realm improvements in the main retail area, specifically Sankey's Corner. "There is also a long term aspiration for a new rail station at Burntwood if the Walsall to Lichfield line is opened to passenger trains." However, the IDP also reveals that many of the proposals will still require significant outside investment to make them a reality. "The retail/leisure offer is dependent upon private sector investment and developer contributions are required to fund the Local Transport Package," the document adds.

Girls actress Allison Williams has married her fianc谷 Ricky Van Veen, revealing her magically gorgeous Oscar de la Renta gown to fans on Instagram last night. The custom dress, made specially for Allison by OdlR designer Peter Copping, struck a perfect balance of drama and simplicity 每 a classic princess line with sheer embroidered sleeves, topped off with a HUGE chiffon train. The back of the dress, shown in a second post from the star, is equally exquisite, with subtle V cutwork and a stiff bow waistband accentuating the silhouette. The wedding was held on Saturday at Brush Creek Ranch in Saratoga, Wyoming, with guests including her Girls co-stars Lena Dunham, Zosia Mamet and Lena Dunham. Friends Katy Perry and John Mayer were also in attendance, according to People. The couple's wedding photos, taken by esteemed photographer Christian Oth, made the most of the incredible landscape, with bride Allison offsetting the prettiness of her dress with a wander down a dirt track. Apologies in advance to the cleaners, then. Allison's new husband Ricky, who she had been dating since 2011, proposed to the 27 year-old star back in February 2014 with a stunning solitaire ring. He is the founder of website College Humor. 'One more. This pretty much sums up my feelings about the whole weekend,' Allison wrote on Insta as she posted a second photo from her big day last night. 'Thank you all for the well-wishes, and thanks to everyone who made it possible.' Tell us what you think of Allison s gown on Twitter @MarieClaireUK.
St. Maarten has beautiful beaches and we ve got to make sure we keep them looking good. This is important for us all as we ll benefit from having clean beaches. It s also very important for our tourism! Join the Garnier team this weekend and help to clean up La Belle Creole in Nettle Bay on Sunday, September 20, from 7:00 to 9:00am. Garnier St. Maarten will proudly contribute to the 2015 International Coastal Cleanup. Coastal Cleanup People around the world gather on beaches, coastlines, seasides, waterways and underwater sites to remove trash. This year s International Coastal Clean Up (ICC) will be on Sunday, September 20. Volunteers are requested not only to pick up trash but also to record every item collected in a standardized data card. The data collected in the International Coastal Cleanup is used to educate people and create solutions to the problems of solid waste. Our ocean generally supplies much of the air we breathe, the food we eat and the water we drink. That means no matter where you live, your life depends on the ocean. Just because the ocean is free and so seemingly vast, we assume it can take care of itself. With the efforts to facilitate the volunteers efficiently with materials to clean up the trash, safely and hygienically, the Medicosmetics team is enthusiastic to be a part of the driving force and is expecting all men on deck for the cause.

Kylie Jenner is facing a very strange accusation... Teenage girl, Chelsea Clark, has apparently asked for a temporary restraining order on the star under claims she has been harassing the teenager for years! According to the Daily Mail, Clark is citing reasons for the claims are due to threatening messages from Kylie during a relationship Clark says she had with Will Smith s son, Jaden Smith - also, Kylie s ex-boyfriend. Clark also says that Kylie organised to have her followed, and said, Leave my boyfriend alone cause you will never be like me (sic). Police have reportedly confirmed that Clark also believes a car accident she was in was organised by Kylie and that, since Clark did not provide evidence for her claims, the protection order has been denied at this point. Although Daily Mail reports that a hearing has been scheduled for October 9 this year, Kylie Jenner doesn t appear to be particularly fazed...

So the story goes that someone once challenged Ernest Hemingway to write a story in just six words. The result? "For sale: baby shoes, never worn." Starting in 2006, SMITH Magazine asked its readers for their own six-word memoirs, and they responded by the thousands. That led to the original book, "Not Quite What I Was Planning," which was filled with poignant, funny and inspirational memoirs. The book spent six weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and a phenomenon was born. With a tip of our hat to SMITH Magazine, we ask our readers to share their own six-word summary of their thoughts on a particular topic. The topic will change at our whim.

IPSWICH General Hospital has these many years been in metaphorical and geographic terms the Crown of Ipswich. The jewel to this crown must surely be the Emergency Department. On August 17 I had, by misadventure, occasion to visit the Ipswich General Hospital Emergency Department. The triage nurses, absolutely run off their feet, were amazing. The patience and care shown to every patient, relative and friend was more than professional, it was indicative of the vocation of health care. This care extended through to reception, to doctors and radiologist, ambos and police. I wish to acknowledge and thank you.

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the apex body of Indian Muslims, has decided to launch a nationwide campaign against attempts by the government to impose Brahminical culture and vedic dharam . Voicing concern over the threats posed to the religious and cultural identity of minorities and other groups, the board announced the launch of the deen aur dastur bachao (save religion and constitution) campaign. The board has also involved other minority groups and organisations from the depressed classes in the campaign. Stating that an "alarming" situation was prevailing in the country, AIMPB general secretary Moulana Sajjad Naomani told a news conference here on Saturday that the attempts to impose a Brahminical social order and rituals like yoga, surya namaskar and Vande Mataram were against the Indian Constitution. "This is not bothering just Muslims but also all other social and religious units. As the largest minority, the board took up the responsibility to take all along and launch a movement to save our faith and constitution," he said. As part of the campaign public meetings, seminars and symposiums would be organised to bring about public awareness and to demand implementation of the constitution in letter and spirit. The board also plans to wage a legal battle by challenging the imposition of Brahminical rituals.

- The ACU Wildcats are back in game week mode following a much needed bye week after a season opening loss to Fresno State.

It s just the third year for the Husky Football program, with ACU owning a 2-0 record. But HBU has improved every year since, and will look to be a tough task come Saturday. For ACU, the team is just excited to be back on their home turf to begin a tough stretch ahead. "Every week, from now on, we re going ten straight, and every week is going to be tough," said Senior linebacker Lynn Grady on Wednesday. "We re going to have to play well and execute to get wins." "The thing that we re ready for, is to get into a groove," explained head coach Ken Collums. "We have not been in a groove. We haven t had a normal week since these guys have shown up. Our guys have worked hard, and we need a good quality home win and that s what we plan on doing." Kickoff is set for 6pm on Saturday.

SYDNEY: Australian shares tumbled to a three-week low on Tuesday as the emergence of Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister elect failed to inspire investors, and falling commodity prices sent resources lower. The changeover of futures contracts set to expire on Sept. 15 also generated heavy trading in those derivatives, draining volume from the equities market and exaggerating the fall. The S&P/ASX 200 index followed overseas markets by falling 1.5 per cent or 78.1 points to 5,018.4, its lowest finish since hitting a two-year low on Aug. 24. The benchmark is down 11 percent since the start of August. New Zealand s benchmark NZX 50 index fell 13.5 points or 0.2 per cent to finish the session at 5,652.4.

Taiwan's labor ministry is working to establish a mechanism to retain foreign skilled workers. Many foreign workers are about to meet their 12-year employment limit. Deputy minister of the labor ministry Chen Yi-Min said Tuesday that the ministry is working with the legislature to allow qualified foreign workers to have longer work permits. "Currently, the consensus reached by both the ruling party and the opposition party is to keep the 12-year limit, and set a new system," said Chen. "In other words, a worker needs to have worked in Taiwan for 12 years, and the employer needs to want to retain the worker. He should have good language abilities, communication skills, and mature work skills. Then the worker can stay if he passes the ministry's review." Chen also said Taiwan is facing a shortage in its workforce. Starting next year, the number of people working will decrease by 180,000 per year on average. The retention system is expected to keep foreign workers with good work skills in Taiwan in the face of this trend.

In this paradise, Red (Jason Sudeikis, We're the Millers, Horrible Bosses), a bird with a temper problem, speedy Chuck (Josh Gad in his first animated role since Frozen), and the volatile Bomb (Danny McBride, This is the End, Eastbound and Down) have always been outsiders.

Michael McCarthy 1 Seattle The leading organization of US prison administrators has described the prolonged isolation of individuals in solitary confinement in US jails and prisons as a "grave problem" and called for the measure to be used less frequently and for the conditions in which isolated prisoners are held to be improved. The Association of State Correctional Administrators said in a statement, "The insistence on change comes not only from legislators across the political spectrum, judges, and a host of private sector voices, but also from the directors of correctional systems at both state and federal levels." The statement coincided with the publication of a report by the association and the Arthur Liman Public Interest Program at Yale Law School in New Haven, Connecticut, on the number of prisoners held in solitary confinement nationwide and the conditions in which they are held. 1 The report estimated that in 2014 some 80 000 to 100 000 people were held in ＃

RBI suggested banks to consider marginal cost of funds to calculate individual lending rates. RBI said that it would implement these proposals with effect from April 1, 2016. Banks were asked submit a road map clearly indicating the time frame for adopting these guidelines two months prior to the final implementation. The components of Base Rate will include cost of funds, negative carry on CRR/SLR, un-allocable overhead costs and average return on networth. "For monetary transmission to occur, lending rates have to be sensitive to the policy rate," said RBI in the draft guidelines. At present, banks follow different methodologies for computing their Base Rate. While some use the average cost of funds method, some have adopted the marginal cost of funds while others use the blended cost of funds (liabilities) method. "It was observed that Base Rates based on marginal cost of funds are more sensitive to changes in the policy rates," In the first Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement this fiscal the RBI had stated that in order to improve the efficiency of monetary policy transmission, it will encourage banks to move in a time-bound manner to margina＃

The Tiger Eye P.I. team has therefore issued a statement cautioning members of the public to be careful. As earlier said, Judge Dery withdrew his injunction on premiering the video today. He was seeking 17 reliefs from the fast track High Court. This means the premiere shall go on uninterrupted at the AICC tonight. However he has been granted a substituted service since the court was finding a hard time serving Anas and his team. This means Anas is considered served once the notice is pasted on the court's notice board. Proof of service would be mailed to him as well. High Court has adjourned the case by the judges challenging the legitimacy of the Chief Justice's disciplinary committee. Vote for this Article Spread the word
The agency has been concerned about struck-by incidents in mines for several years. Sep 02, 2015 MSHA is publishing a proposed rule that would require proximity detection systems on underground coal hauling systems used on a mining section. Machines such as shuttle cars, ram cars, and scoops would have to be equipped with technology that prevents coal miners from becoming struck, pinned, or crushed. MSHA has been calling for the use of such technology for several years , but its release about the rule says that, as of June 2015, only 155 of the approximately 2,116 underground coal hauling machines and scoops were equipped with proximity detection systems. The technology uses electronic sensors to detect motion and the distance between a miner and a machine, alerting operator and miner through audible and visual warnings and automatically stopping the machine s movement before miners are injured. According to the agency, between 1984 and 2014, 42 miners died and 179 were hurt in pinning, crushing, and struck-by incidents, and during 2010-2014, there were nine miner fatalities in 41 cases -- 23 involved coal hauling machines and 18 involved scoops. "This proposed proximity detection system rule would better protect miners from being crushed or pinned in the confined underground mine spaces where large equipment is constantly in motion," said Assistant Secretary Joe Main. "It is an important component of the department s Plan, Prevent and Protect strategy for safeguarding all workers."

England fly-half Owen Farrell would have backed himself to kick the draw-salvaging penalty in the closing moments of Saturday s 28-25 World Cup defeat by Wales. 19 minutes ago PA Sport . View photo Owen Farrell agreed with the decision to go for touch but would have backed himself to kick penalty England fly-half Owen Farrell would have backed himself to kick the draw-salvaging penalty in the closing moments of Saturday s 28-25 World Cup defeat by Wales. Captain Chris Robshaw opted to go for touch to set up an attacking line-out in the 78th minute instead of giving Farrell, who had kicked flawlessly all night and finished with a 20-point haul, the shot at goal. Robshaw suggested that had the penalty not been close to the touchline, he might have made a different decision. Farrell agreed with the call but believes he would have hit the mark had he been given the chance. A draw against a heavyweight rival in a ferociously competitive Pool A that also includes Australia might ultimately prove the difference between a group exit and a place in the quarter-finals. "As a kicker, if the decision as a group was to go for goal, then obviously you back yourself - that s why you do the job," Farrell said. "We believed that we could win the game by doing that. We backed ourselves to score the try there and unfortunately it didn t work out.

By 24 A group of North West African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) members, who brought an urgent application to prevent the ANCYL congress from going ahead, could be expelled from the ANC for bringing the party into disrepute, a senior official said on Thursday. "They knew as they took the decision to go to court they will face the wrath of the party," national task team convener Fikile Mbalula said ahead of the start of the congress. "They knew they could be disciplined and could fall in the spheres of suspension in the organisation, the outcome of that decision could even lead to expulsion from the party," said Mbalula. He said the group took a risk by challenging the national task team. "They undermined the party and brought the ANC into disrepute. They will face the wrath of the party, because what they did is an act that will never go unnoticed. We will attend to it." On Friday, the group turned to the North Gauteng High Court in a bid to prevent the congress from going ahead. The group alleged there were unresolved disputes relating to the exclusion of delegates. Judge Moses Mavundla ruled the matter was not urgent and dismissed it with costs. The applicants, including Thabo Molamu, Mbuyiselo Booi, Gonste Maruping and Papa Jood, were represented by Advocate Herman Waldick in the case against the first respondent, the ANCYL national task team and second respondent, the North West provincial executive committee.
An American Airlines flight to Chicago made an emergency landing Monday because of an allegedly unruly passenger, authorities said. American Airlines Flight 1284, which departed from Miami, ended up landing in Indianapolis. The female passenger became unruly during the flight, according to an Indianapolis Airport Authority spokesman. "She was disoriented through the entire flight," passenger Marian Frendt told ABC station WLS-TV in Chicago. "She started kicking the seat of the passenger in front of her, and he apparently turned around to complain ... and she hit him." When a flight attendant intervened, the woman allegedly grabbed the attendant s face and kissed her, then punched her in the face. Authorities said the woman also kicked a police officer while being arrested. The woman - who has not been identified - was escorted off the plane in flex-cuffs. Passengers filmed the scene as officers helped her into the back of a patrol car. She was charged with battery with injury, battery without injury, battery of a public safety officer, criminal recklessness, disorderly conduct and disruption the operation of an aircraft, authorities said. The disruption caused the flight to arrive in Chicago about 90 minutes late.

Two-time University of Notre Dame All-America split end Thom Gatewood will be honored Saturday at halftime of the Notre Dame-Massachusetts football game at Notre Dame Stadium for his selection to the College Football Hall of Fame Class of 2015. Gatewood didn t waste any time of heading into the spotlight however. He stole the show at the pep rally Friday night at the Compton Family Ice Arena. After video from his playing days were shown on the jumbotron, Gatewood joked, "eat your heart out Will Fuller." Fuller fittingly became the first player since Gatewood to open a season with three straight 100 yard receiving games. Gatewood shared some fun stories including the recruiting letter he received from Ara Parseghian that focused on academics and not football. Gatewood also had some fun to pep up Saturday s game. This place is loaded with positive enthusiasm and positive environment. Mix it with talent and what do you got. 4-and-oh tomorrow. 4-and-oh. 4 and oh," Gatewood said jumping up and down on the stage. An NCAA consensus All-America pick in 1970, Gatewood becomes the 45th former Notre Dame player〞and the first since tight end Dave Casper in 2012〞to join the College Football Hall of Fame. With 45 former players and six former coaches selected, Notre Dame boasts more honorees than any other school in the country. Gatewood is only the second true receiver from Notre Dame (Tim Brown is the other) to earn selection to the Hall of Fame.
By By | Reuters 每 By Phil Stewart WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia has started flying drone aircraft on surveillance missions in Syria, two U.S. officials said on Monday, in what appeared to be Moscow s first military air operations inside the country since staging a rapid buildup at a Syrian air base. The U.S. officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, could not immediately say how many Russian drones were involved in the surveillance missions or the scope of the flights. The Pentagon declined to comment. The start of Russian drone flights underscored the risks of U.S.-led coalition aircraft and Russian flights operating in Syria s limited airspace. U.S. and Russian defense chiefs agreed on Friday to explore ways to avoid accidental interactions, also known as "deconfliction" in military parlance. The discussions may gain added urgency, now that Moscow has started drone flights. The former Cold War foes have a common adversary in Islamic State militants in Syria, even as Washington opposes Moscow s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, seeing him as a driving force in the nation s devastating, four-and-a-half-year civil war. But Russia may also want to target opposition fighters that the United States supports in Syria, seeing them as equal threats to Assad. Russia s drone operations appeared to be staged out of an air base near Latakia, where it has moved heavy military equipment, including fighter jets, helicopter gunships and naval infantry forces in recent days, U.S. officials said.

Great British Bake Off fans will recall Richard Burr as the calm and competent builder from last year's series, who always had a pencil tucked behind his ear 每 and it seems lots of viewers decided he must be as good at building as he was at baking. "The business went huge after Bake Off," the 39-year-old revealed. "I could have just used it to expand, but I wanted to have some fun with food, too." The ex-contestant, who was a finalist on the show, is bringing out a cookery book titled BIY: Bake It Yourself, where he shares some of his favourite recipes, such as millefeuille, mincemeat muffins, and blackberry and elderflower pavlovas. Richard Burr (BBC) "I got to spend the whole winter making all of my favourite food," he said. The father-of-two also encourages his two daughters, who are six and three, to join him in the kitchen, joking: "I'm an early bird, so I'll often be kicking around with the girls in the morning, and if it's a choice between cooking in the kitchen or watching Nickelodeon, I'd rather have them in here with me."

French architect, Jacques Rougerie, has designed a floating scientific city which could be home to 7,000 researchers, teachers and students. The "City of Meriens"- which means "belonging to the sea" 每 is intended as an international oceanographic university dedicated to the observation and analysis of marine biodiversity. Rougerie said: "I feel very, very good underwater. I feel different. Another type of imagination is awakened in me as soon as I am underwater." The self-sustaining research centre will be 900m long and 500m wide, with classrooms, lecture halls, laboratories, living quarters and even sporting and leisure zones. In addition, the "university city" is designed to be completely sustainable with plans to run on renewable marine energy with zero waste production.

The falling cost of intelligent robots may help bring back car manufacturing to the EU and US Donald Walker, Chief Executive of auto supplier Magna suggested that rising wages in China and the cost of importing heavy components like electric car batteries into Europe may lead established car makers to introduce more highly efficient automated manufacturing closer to home. Speaking at the Frankfurt auto show Walker said that assembly plants were evolving and the cost of robots was going down. By 2025 the total cost of manufacturing labor is projected to fall between 18 and 33 percent in countries which already deploy industrial robots, including South Korea, China, the U.S. Germany and Japan, a study on advanced manufacturing technologies by the Boston Consulting Group showed. The emergence of hybrid and electric cars means auto makers have seen an increasing demand for large batteries, Walker explained. "If you look at a battery, it is a big heavy thing to ship. The things that hold the battery, the bumpers, the wheels, those are big bulky parts," Walker said. "I think you will still see cars made where the market is. And based on that, the big bulky parts and a lot of the technology in there, will probably be made locally," Walker said

Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka will make a late decision on defender Ben Gibson ahead of Tuesday night s Sky Bet Championship clash with Brentford at the Riverside Stadium. The England Under-21 international limped off four minutes into the second half of Saturday s 2-0 victory over MK Dons with a hamstring injury. However, Karanka has revealed that the damage does not appear to be too serious and will give Gibson until the last minute to prove his fitness, although the Spaniard will not risk him if he is not 100 per cent fit. The Boro boss otherwise has no fresh selection issues with only long-term absentees Rhys Williams, Alex Baptiste and Damia Abella still missing. Brentford may again have midfielder Andy Gogia available after he missed Saturday s 1-1 draw at Leeds through injury. There could also be first starts for new arrivals Ryan Woods and Sergi Canos. However, manager Marinus Dijkhuizen remains without several long-term absentees. Jota (ankle), Josh McEachran (foot), Marcos Tebar (hamstring), Andreas Bjelland and Scott Hogan (both knee) are all still unavailable.

A Mississippi tractor-trailer driver will spend time behind bars for driving around in the tractor cab portion of his rig without his employer's permission. Cedric B. Davidson, 49, was sentenced to six to 23 months in jail after pleading guilty earlier this week in Montgomery County Court to a misdemeanor offense of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Davidson, a tractor-trailer driver employed by Western Express Inc. out of Tennessee, came into contact with Upper Gwynedd police on June 14 when he called to turn himself in, according to the criminal complaint. His employer had sent him on a job assignment that involved picking up a 46,939-pound load of lumber in Massachusetts on June 6 and delivering the lumber to a business in North Carolina no later than June 11, the complaint said. Instead, according to the criminal complaint, he took a side trip to Camden, New Jersey, where he used the lumber to purchase an unspecified amount of crack cocaine. Davidson told police, according to the complaint, that he spent the next several days just driving the tractor cab randomly in the area before deciding to turn himself in.

St. Philip's Episcopal Church will be at Strawberry Fields for Rover Off-Leash Dog Park on Sunday, Oct. 4, 1-2 p.m ., for a Blessing of the Animals. Marysville Dog Owners Group (M-DOG) will also be hosting their first Pet Memorial Balloon event following the blessings at 2:30 p.m. Purchase a balloon, write a message or name of a pet that has passed away on the balloon and M-DOG will line the fence inside the dog park. The balloons will be white with red ribbons so visitors to the dog park can walk around and view these balloons all week at the off-leash park. Proceeds from these balloons go to the dog park for supplies. M-DOG is the all volunteer nonprofit group that maintains the dog park. M-DOG had originally planned a balloon release but the dog park is too close to Arlington Airport flight path. Strawberry Fields for Rover Off-Leash Dog Park is located at 6100 152nd St. NE in Marysville. M-DOG has recently installed new agility equipment in the dog park from the proceeds raised from Poochapalooza. A new bench has been installed donated by Roy Robinson Chevrolet-Subaru.
Alexander Bueso (ShareCast News) - The People s Republic of China s foreign exchange reserves dropped last month as the country moved to weaken its currency by selling US dollars. The Asian giant s stockpile of greenbacks decreased to $3.56trn from $3.65trn a month before, slightly more than economists had penciled in. China s reserves have more than tripled over the past decade - to become the third largest on the planet - as the country bought US currency in a bid to slow a strengthening yuan as its trade balance ballooned. "Today s data on China s foreign exchange reserves suggest that the People s Bank (PBOC) is not burning through its reserves as quickly as many had believed. "[...] Indeed, some commentators had suggested the PBOC may have sold as much as $200bn which, if such rapid sales were sustained, would mean that China s FX reserves would be depleted within a couple of years," Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics said. -- More to follow --
Panaji: Senior officers of directorate of transport are likely to fall in trouble as Dattaram Damu Gaude, a peon working in transport department who was arrested for demanding and accepting bribe, agreed to disclose the names before the magistrate for whom he collected the money. Anti-corruption branch (ACB) of directorate of vigilance had arrested Gaude. ACB officers have moved an application before the judicial magistrate first class, Panaji, to record the statement of Gaude under Section 164 CrPC. An ACB officer said that the statement is likely to be recorded on Monday. ACB on Thursday quizzed transport director Arun Desai in the corruption case. Desai was questioned for nearly an hour in the case. An ACB officer said that Desai was called to verify whether he has any role in the case. In June, the cyber-crime cell of Goa police arrested assistant motor vehicle inspector Alister Fernandes and subsequently released him on bail for allegedly hacking into an email account and impersonating a government officer. Fernandes wife was also arrested and released on bail. Fernandes did not intimate the transport department about his arrest, the department issued a show cause notice to him. The officer said that Fernandes filed his reply to the notice. While the inquiry was in progress, Gaude, approached Fernandes and told him that he would be dismissed if the case is not amicably settled. tnn

Spanish giants Real Madrid are targeting Chelsea star Eden Hazard, according to The Sunday Times. Madrid president Florentino Perez has made the Belgium international his latest galactico transfer target, the report claims. The 24-year-old, who was the Professional Footballers' Association Players' Player of the Year last season, has failed to show his best form so far this season, though he did show glimpses of his old self during yesterday's 2-2 draw at Newcastle United. Hazard is said to be the star player Perez wants to make his next major signing. He broke the world record to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for 80m in 2009. They broke their own record to land Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013, and signed World Cup star James Rodriguez from Monaco in 2014. Having failed to complete a deal for Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea in the last transfer window, attention will seemingly turn to Hazard next summer.

Fans of the Harry Potter series are some the most die-hard fans there are. It's been eight long years for "Harry Potter" fans. That's when author J.K. Rowling finished the 7th and final book in her wildly successful series. While Rowling isn't writing any "Harry Potter" novels, that hasn't stopped her from adding to the young wizard's story. The author posted a brief essay titled "The Potter Family" giving more background about the Potter family on Pottermore.com. In the essay, Rowling traces Harry s roots to "the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, the Potterer , became corrupted in time to Potter. " She also gives fans the backstory on the "Invisibility Cloak," which was made possible by a "beautiful young witch" named Iolanthe Peverell.

Today s post is late and brief as I ve been out most of the day so far. A one day thing. Yesterday s tape was a mess. A bullish breakout that failed, then a bearish breakout that failed, leaving a brutal bull trap at the close in the form of a 70\% bullish falling wedge, a possible double bottom setup and a supportive 5min buy signal. Sometimes these are topping patterns though and that was the case here. The wedge has broken down with a target in the 1908 area, and I m expecting to see a 1903 r
QPR will try to make another attempt to sign forward Ravel Morrison from Lazio in January. Morrison has been training with Lazio since February, but has made only two appearances for the Serie A club. There has been speculation that the 22-year-old has not settled in Italy and Rangers tried to take advantage by luring him to Loftus Road in August. That attempt failed but Morrison's lack of first-team football has encouraged QPR to make another move. The club believe they can get the best out of the England Under-21 international, who impressed while on loan at Loftus Road between February and May in 2014. Morrison signed a pre-contract with Lazio after being released by West Ham seven months ago and had looked good in pre-season training. But things have turned sour and he missed a 5-0 defeat against Napoli at the weekend with a stomachache. Significantly Lazio coach Stefano Pioli said: "He's sick, but he's yet to fully adapt to the schemes."

CNN: Size matters: Is the U.S. Navy really too small? (CNN)For decades, the United States has had the world s largest and most advanced naval fleet, positioning ships and aircraft carriers in strategic locations across the globe to protect national interests and facilitate free trade. But as rival nations, such as China and Russia, expand their own naval capabilities, and with China s increasingly aggressive posture in the South China Sea, GOP presidential candidates are warning voters that America s dominance of the world s oceans could end unless lawmakers add significantly more ships to its arsenal to bring the fleet size closer to historic levels. Former military officials and defense experts, however, say that weighing the current size of the Navy against past ship levels is a misleading comparison that misses the broader point: making sure the Navy is capable of achieving U.S. strategic goals, which depend as much on technological capability and force deployment as the raw number of ships. While many analysts think the Navy needs to grow, others think it s large enough -- given its global dominance -- and that funding realities mean there s a limit to how much it could expand in any case. WNU Editor: It all depends on what is the mission .... and what are U.S. national security priorities. This is a debate that we should have now .... unfortunately .... my gut is telling me that it is not going to happen.
 Ikeme in action for Wolves Goalkeeper trainer of Nigeria's Super Eagles, Alloy Agu, has tipped English-born Carl Ikeme as a good replacement for Captain Vincent Enyeama in the goalkeeping department of the senior national team. The Wolverhampton Wanderers goalkeeper, Ikeme was handed a surprise number one shirt by Chief Coach Sunday Oliseh when first choice goal keeper Enyeama ruled himself out of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match against Tanzania last weekend due to the death of his mother. Debutant Ikeme proved doubting Nigerians wrong by putting up a sterling performance, saving the Eagles from disgrace in Dar es Salam, as Nigeria played a goalless draw with their hosts. Agu, who was happy with the new discovery, said Ikeme has shown that he can conveniently serve as the replacement for Enyeama in the Eagles. "The expectation of Eagles' coaches has been met in Ikeme. He really showcased himself against Tanzania on Saturday. He came in at the right time and performed extremely well. Definitely we are glad with this new development. We will continue to monitor his progress in his club to see how the future of this young man will be in the senior team," Agu said. Meanwhile, Ahmed Musa who captained Oliseh's Eagles against Tanzania last weekend has called on Nigerians to have patience with the team. According to him, the Eagles are undergoing rebuilding process, adding that what happened in Dar es Salam was due to the short time the team had to train together before the qualifier.

Toni Collette has insisted she had no problem shaving her head to play a cancer sufferer in her new movie Miss You Already. The 42-year-old actress stars with Drew Barrymore in the comedy drama about two best friends whose relationship is tested when one is diagnosed with cancer while the other is struggling with IVF treatment in order to have a baby.

SOURCE Mark Lerner Productions Empowering People Through Challenges & Change MELVILLE, N.Y. Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150922/269245 Today, an innovative nonfiction educational series entitled SESSIONS with Dr. Mark Lerner is fostering emotional wellness. This timely production features a psychologist and his "clients" - people who have walked the journey from victim to survivor and, ultimately, thriver. Instead of scripted sessions portrayed by actors, distinguished "real people" enact unscripted sessions, from years past, when they were grappling with challenging experiences. They then elucidate how they learned to harness their painful emotional energy, and use that energy to overcome. As our world becomes increasing technological, this timely SVOD series demonstrates the importance of interpersonal face-to-face communication, particularly during challenging times.

In 2007, a North Carolina man named Shannon Whisnant bought the contents of an abandoned storage unit at auction. Inside the unit was a smoker. Inside the smoker, a mummified human foot. Ever watchful for an opportunity to gain fame and make a quick buck, Whisnant tried to parlay his find into a tourist attraction, charging three bucks for a peek at the leathery limb; he even had t-shirts and other merchandise made, dubbing himself "The Foot Man." But go figure, the foot did indeed belong to someone: John Wood, who had lost it after a plane crash in 2004 that also took the life of his father. He had saved it because he wanted eventually to be buried with it, but he fell on hard times, struggled with addiction, lost his home, and, eventually, his storage unit.That s a pretty fascinating story right there, but in the documentary Finders Keepers, directors - Bilge Ebiri
IRVINE, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/09/15 -- has been recently awarded its third and fourth patents -- US 9,119,941 & US 9,119,942 -- to solidify its innovation platform base in the guidewire controller / torque assist market. New claim additions will allow Vesatek to protect its current novel mechanical device offering, while expanding coverage to alternate embodiments, such as purely manual actuated devices. Vesatek s broadening IP footprint continues to be guided by Knobbe Martens Olson and Bear, LLP. The battery operated FireBow device is an easy-to-use, single handed wire controller that torques, spins and oscillates guidewires reducing hand fatigue without sacrificing distal wire feel, as the thumb and fingers never need to leave the wire. Expanding usual convention, the device can be manually slowed, halted with a light wire pinch or single finger interference in addition to standard electronic controls. "This technology has the potential to improve operator performance during numerous other procedures in the cath lab and surgery as well," commented Brad Culbert, vice president of engineering for Vesatek. Company president David Look believes the market for these types of devices is fertile. "We have seen an increased merger and acquisitions appetite for simple devices that solve complex issues in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Just last month, Merit Medical Systems licensed the SPINR platform IP from Distal Access."

Macclesfield inflicted just a second defeat of the season on Woking. Kristian Dennis tapped home his sixth goal of the season in the first half after Woking keeper Jake Cole spilled a cross from Andy Halls. Neill Byrne hammered home from after the break after the visitors failed to clear after Cole had saved from a Dennis header. The Cards gave themselves a chance when defender Joey Jones fired home from 20 yards but the Silkmen held on. Woking boss Garry Hill told BBC Surrey: "We ve had a good run recently, with five wins and a draw, and you can t complain and be too hard on the players. "We had a good start after eight games with 16 points and today Macclesfield s desire, hunger and physical presence told in a big way. "I thought we were very average in the first half and over in the ninety minutes I felt that Jake Cole made some good saves. "This leagues a punishing league and you have to learn quick, turn round and keep going."

There was an old wooden cupboard. It was covered from top to bottom with carved roses and tulips. In the middle of the cupboard door was the carved figure of a man - children called him Major general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat's-legs. He was always looking at the table under the looking-glass, where stood a very pretty little shepherdess made of china. Close to her stood a little chimney-sweep who was also made of china. Close to them stood another figure - Chinaman who could nod his head and thought himself that he was a grandfather of the shepherdess. The shepherdess and the chimney-sweep loved each other, but Chinaman wanted her marriage with Major general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat's-legs. One day the shepherdess and the chimney-sweep decided to escape their house to the open world. What troubles did they face?

When someone is undergoing cancer treatment, its important that they involve their dentist in their program of care. They should schedule a dental exam and cleaning before the treatment actually begins and then repeat it periodically during the course of treatment. Its important that they tell the dentist that they are being treated for cancer and that they also discuss any dental procedures, such as extractions or insertion of dental implants, with the oncologist before starting the cancer treatment. Its therefore a good idea to ensure that the dentist and oncologist have each others details to enable them to discuss any issues to help the patient. And the dentist and physician should be informed about any issues such as bleeding of the gums, pain, or unusual feeling in the teeth or gums, or any dental infections. Maintaining excellent oral hygiene during cancer treatment is vital to reduce the risk of infection and to help aid the treatment process.

A malfunction at its Aughrim Annacurragh Water Treatment Plant led to Irish Water imposing a boil water notice for customers last Sunday after the presence of ecoli was detected during subsequent water sampling. The notice was issued on the advice of the HSE as a precautionary measure. Irish Water said the malfunction at the treatment works had resulted in lower than normal levels of chlorine dosing. The dosing levels returned to normal the next day but Irish Water has kept the boil water notice in place until the sampling process shows the drinking water is compliant and safe for public consumption. Around 600 houses that are on the Aughrim Annacurragh Public Water Supply Scheme in County Wicklow have been affected by the situation.

I miss watermelon season! In the past few months, I have been cutting and eating several watermelons. Check out the past FoodMeOmaha post, "FoodMeTrivia Series 4: Watermelon Basics". Among the several watermelons, I discovered one that stood out among the rest. On August 19th, I cut a "normal" watermelon in half and then I was surprised by the insides... It looked like someone purposefully carved out a biohazard symbol! What caused this symmetrical structure? Is it safe to eat? The exposed watermelon flesh is whitish, dry, and rubbery. After some googling, I learned that this is a watermelon with a hollow heart. The internal pattern naturally happens due to poor pollination during the growth process. Fortunately, this intriguing watermelon is safe to eat. The dry parts were discarded and the remaining watermelon was eaten. While I had less watermelon to eat, the taste quality was not impacted. In fact, it was a wonderfully juicy and sweet. Still curious about the hollow heart watermelon? Here are some online resources about the natural hollow heart occurrence in watermelons. UDaily s Saving Watermelons - University of Delaware shares information on the watermelon hollow heart and a pollination research study. Amusing Planet s Hollow Heart in Watermelon - There are neat pics of different hollow heart watermelons.
Brimbank council could announce its new chief executive as early as next week. Current CEO Bill Jaboor said in July that he would retire in October this year, ending a 46-year career in local government. Chairman of Brimbank administrators John Watson said the council was hoping to appoint a new chief executive "mid [to] late September". The council would not reveal its list of candidates for "privacy" reasons. Star Weekly understands all three administrators are on the selection panel for the new chief executive. In its job advertisement, the council said it was looking for an "experienced, agile leader", who would "support the transition back to democratically elected representatives" after residents go back to the polls in October 2016. Appointed in 2012, Mr Jaboor said he had originally planned to stay long enough to assist a new council. "Since the proposed March 2015 election was delayed, I have been considering the timing. With several key projects well under way, I feel now is the best time to make my move," Mr Jaboor said.

Michael Fallon said the Government would "not hesitate" to repeat the action that led to Britons being killed by an RAF drone in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqah last month. Reyaad Khan, a British citizen fighting for Islamic State, was killed in an RAF drone attack in Syria Prime Minister David Cameron revealed that jihadist Reyaad Khan, accused by the intelligence services of plotting "barbaric" attacks on "high-profile public commemorations" in the UK, was killed by a missile fired at his vehicle on August 21. Mr Fallon defended the move and said the Government would use military strikes again if there was no other way to stop the terror cells. He told BBC Radio 4 s Today programme: "There are other terrorists involved in other plots that may come to fruition over the next few weeks and months and we wouldn t hesitate to take similar action again."

George Clooney isn t taking Donald Trump s run for president seriously - and he doesn t think history will either. During a Toronto Film Festival press conference for his film Our Brand Is Crisis , Clooney didn t hold back when it came to Trump and the GOP frontrunner s remarks about Mexican immigrants. "Clearly, what he said is idiotic, of course it s idiotic," Clooney said, according to Us Weekly . "Anybody who says as intolerant words as those should be laughed at and that s pretty much [what] I think eventually history will do." Donald Trump on Tonight Show : The good, the bad, and the delusional In June, Trump made offensive remarks about Mexicans, referring to them as criminals and rapists. "The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else s problems," he said at the kickoff event for his campaign. "They re sending people that have lots of problems and they re brining those problems with us. They re bringing drugs. They re bringing crime. They re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."

American author Edgar Allan Poe is best known for his mournful poetry and eerie short stories. He also had plenty to say about what we today call interior design.

The ministers will try to narrow a yawning divide over how to share responsibility for thousands of migrants arriving daily and ease the burden on frontline states. Their talks will focus on distributing 160,000 refugees over the next two years. The arrival of around 500,000 migrants so far this year has taken the EU by surprise and it has responded slowly. The ministers will confirm the distribution of an initial 40,000 refugees, but this scheme was conceived in May and some nations still do not plan to do their full share before year s end.

Not your average OOTD. When 34-year-old mother-of-one Lisa Rossiter was diagnosed with cancer, she decided to put up a fight, and fashion was her biggest ally. Lisa, who lives in Perth with her husband Greg and son Wynter, was diagnosed with bowel cancer at the age of 33. The diagnosis was sudden and devastating, but Lisa knew that the best thing she could do 每 other than start treatment asap 每 was stay positive. And the way she decided to do that was through fashion. On the first day of chemotherapy Lisa wore a very un-hospitaly bright yellow sheer panelled skirt, which she posted on Instagram with the message 'Sunshine yellow skirt to keep me positive'. With that first picture Lisa also started the hashtag FightCancerWithFashion 每 which cemented her mission. Over the six months of treatment, Lisa posted an astonishing 125 documenting her fashion choices as well as her treatments, and attracted followers and well wishers from all over the world. Talking to That's Life magazine in Australia, Lisa explained: 'Some days I had no energy at all, but I'd still post a pic, 'I didn't want to make light of my situation, but it helped me stay connected with my friends and family.' In July, Lisa had her last chemo treatment, and will find out if her treatment was successful in December. She told That's Life magazine that until then, she'd continue to make the most of every moment. And that's a lesson we'd all do well to learn.
Livingston Parish deputies issued a summons to drunken man who was found riding his horse home from a bar in Denham Springs in the early morning hours on Tuesday. The horseman had driven his truck and horse trailer to the bar sometime earlier, Livingston Parish Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Lori Steele said. After getting drunk at the bar, the man told the bartender he'd send someone to pick up the truck and trailer later, then unloaded the horse, saddled up and headed for home, Steele said. Along the way, the horseman was stopped by Livingston Parish deputies, who issued him a summons for disturbing the peace by public intoxication and called someone to pick up both horse and rider. Steele said Tuesday evening she did not have the name of the man who was issued the summons. "That's all the info I have," Steele said.

This November, we made a trip back to Belleville to celebrate Papa s 70th Birthday. A highlight of the trip was seeing Great Grandma Flynn. God love her. I certainly do. Another highlight, spending time with cousins! A rare, but always fun, opportunity! Kaden thought the freezing temps and freezing rain was a special treat - us, not so much! It does make for cute accessories though! After Belleville, we went to Lexington for Thanksgiving with family and friends. It was the first time we had been back for Thanksgiving in several years, so it was a special treat for all of us to be together. We spent lots of time cuddling with Gammi and Pop, seeing old friends, and taking in some of Lexington s fun offerings - ice skating in Triangle Park and a UK basketball game! Our gingers, Kaden and sweet Lucy, cuddling and watching a movie while Allison and I caught up on life. I can hardly believe that she s been in my life since we were the kids ages, but then again I can t imagine my life without her in it! Some special iPad time in the comfy chair! Fly Eagles Fly! Going on a treasure hunt... Skating in Triangle Park Family photo in front of the Christmas Tree in Triangle Park Determined little guy picked it up after insisting he do it on his own! Pop s favorite spot! The wishbone Science lessons with Gammi led to an amazed little boy An effort to get a photo for the Christmas card Go CATS!!
The Trident debate was one of the most passionate of the conference with strongly held views for both the multilateral approach to nuclear disarmament and the unilateral view. What we all agreed on was that we should unite about voting against the like for like replacement of the nuclear arsenal. A position the Conservatives will be taking next year and wasting 100Bn in the process. What we did not agree on was what should be the alternative. So we have set up yet another commission to devise a policy. In my view the policy is very simple 每 simply do not replace the Trident at all at the end of its life and instead make sure our forces are properly equiped to do the job we ask of them with conventional weapons and equipment. We should lead by example and simply say to the world 每 Nuclear Weapons 每 No Thank You. The vote was counted as 579 for multilateral approach to 447 for the unilateral approach.
Langston's Laughs September 25, 2015 The Journal A farmer went to his church for the Sunday evening service and no one showed up but himself and the preacher. They both waited for a while and no one else came so his pastor asked him what he wanted to do. The farmer said all I know is if I go out to feed my cows and only one shows up I feed him. So his preacher said ok, have a seat and I will go to the pulpit. The preacher went to pulpit got out his bible and began preaching. He preached and preached and preached for over an hour and finally he finished. After he came down from the pulpit to where the farmer was he asked him what he thought. The farmer said you know you asked me what we should do and I said that if I went out to feed my cows and only one showed up I would feed him, the preacher said yes I remember. The farmer said what I didn't tell you was that if I was going to feed that one cow I would NOT give him the whole truck load! Posted in: Opinion Tags: Langston s Laughs

TURN THE PAGE Host Kayla Greenwell interviews the literati and oddball creative-types with a focus on DIY and grassroots initiatives. This week, Kayla will interview Ryan Snellman and Christina Wheeler. Viking Poet Ryan Snellman was raised on the dark and rainy streets of Seattle. Educated in an array of practical matters & living a life of quiet solitude one dreams of knowing the heart of a seagull. The life and love affair of a solitary raindrop speaks to the essence of poetry and those Christmas lights hanging in the window of the bar in the middle of January speak to life s unending dream. Ryan is a published poet, in the frequent flyer program for nutballs that see ballgames in all cities, and the co-organizer of the Coffee & Pie Reading Series. Christina Wheeler runs NEARSIGHTED NARWHAL, a shop located in Tacoma, Washington. The Nearsighted Narwhal s sole focus is the myriad forms of the DIY culture. Over 1,000 self-published books, zines, and comics are housed within its four walls, with inventory growing daily. Not only catering to the bookworm crowd, there is also a well-stocked selection of music titles and art from local artists. Nearsighted Narwhal is also home to many creative events, shows, readings, and presentations for schools and organizations.

PETA Credlin has hit back at "unnamed sources" who dogged her final months in Canberra by suggesting cabinet ministers and journalists intimidated by her didn t deserve their jobs. Speaking at the Future Awards in Sydney on Tuesday night, former prime minister Tony Abbott s chief-of-staff spoke candidly about the "bloody tough" time she had experienced as a senior woman in Australian politics over the past decade. In her first in-depth public speaking appearance, Ms Credlin said she "refused to be defined by insider gossip from unnamed sources when no one has the guts to put their name to it". "And if you re a cabinet minister or a journalist and you re intimidated by the chief-of-staff of the prime minister then maybe you don t deserve your job," Ms Credlin said. The blistering comments came after days of speculation that the leadership coup which ended Mr Abbott s prime ministership was in part due to his chief-of-staff s acrimonious relationship with members of the Coalition backbench and the cabinet.

Up to 10 dual citizens now in jail for terrorist offences face the prospect of immediate deportation once they complete their sentences. Under proposed new citizenship laws that are expected to go before the parliament next week, the immigration minister will be given the power to revoke the Australian citizenship of dual nationals jailed for at least six years for terrorism. Liberal MP Dan Tehan, chairman of the parliamentary committee on intelligence and security that examined the citizenship bill, said fewer than 10 dual nationals now in jail will be affected. It is a bipartisan recommendation of the committee and we ll have to wait and see what the government decides to do with regards to it, Mr Tehan told ABC television. This proposal also allows the minister to declare that a dual national serving with a terrorist organisation has, by their own actions, renounced Australian citizenship. Mr Tehan said a group of officials will assess the person s conduct and advise the minister, who will issue a notice saying the person s citizenship has been revoked. AAP

With no more surgically procedures needed on his hand, defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul s sole focus is to heal and to ramp up his conditioning so he can get on the field as soon as possible. Still, he might have to wait until an independent doctor makes a decision on his hand. According to two sources involved in the situation, a doctor with no ties to either the Giants or Pierre-Paul could ultimately make the call on whether the defensive end is healthy enough to play. The Giants, however, obviously don t think he s set to return. They do want him, badly, on the field, but they want to make sure he s ready. If no consensus can be reached between the Giants doctors and JPP s personal doctors, an independent doctor would likely need to make the final call on whether JPP can play, sources said. Pierre-Paul lost his index finger in a fireworks accident on the Fourth of July. A piece of his thumb is also missing, but it s above the knuckle, so he should regain full use of his thumb. After a skin graft and a procedure to clean out his middle finger last week, Pierre-Paul is working toward getting ready for his check-in with the Giants next month.

Photos of the Ford F-250 Super Duty already leaked out a few months ago, but we caught more of a glimpse of it today from a now-deleted YouTube video about the truck's frame. Here it is, in all its screencapped glory. Like the F-150, this new Super Duty will use an aluminum body, and will also probably pack 6.2-liter gasoline and 6.7-liter PowerStoke diesel V8s. More of the car is supposed to be revealed tonight when the official embargo drops. Until then, what do we think? Advertisement Big hat tip to Blake! Contact the author at patrick@jalopnik.com.

It was a very unclear lead-up to the almost historic meeting, with about half of the Street economists expecting a hike. But what ensued after the announcement will surely hurt the Federal Reserve s credibility for some time to come. For the first time -- with the US in a non-crisis mode -- the Fed highlighted another country s slowdown and allowed it to influence its decision not to raise rates from our crisis level of zero. The problem with the Fed being overly sensitive to China s growth plight is simple. The Chinese do not give a rat s ass how the US economy do...
A Mount Pleasant man has been arraigned in the Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Court in connection with a hit and run traffic accident that seriously injured a Flint man. Samuel Maykiss Pego, 26, was arraigned Tuesday on charges of failing to report a traffic accident, driving on a suspended license, reckless driving, commission of a crime with a weapon, assault and battery, and domestic violence, stemming from the hit and run as well as a domestic assault, the Morning Sun reports. The incidents occurred on the same day. The hit and run occurred at 2:11 a.m. at the intersection of South Washington and Cherry streets. A Flint man, 22, was struck by a black sedan as he was crossing South Washington, Mount Pleasant Police reported. The sedan fled the scene. Officers later received a tip that led to the vehicle, and video surveillance showed the driver of the car, who was known to police from previous encounters. Police were told the suspect was at a Mount Pleasant home; it was there that a woman accused the suspect of assaulting her. The suspect was arrested and remanded to the tribal court because he is Native American and the crimes occurred in the boundaries of the reservation.

LeBron James is putting his money where his mouth is when it comes to his commitment to the children involved with his "I Promise" campaign through his LeBron James Family Foundation charity. King James has partnered with the University of Akron to give four-year scholarships to any child who completes his "I Promise" campaign. The annual tuition is $9,500, so it's a $38,000 commitment to each student who qualifies. There are currently 1,100 kids in the program, and 1,200 more are expected to be added in the next four years, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. Quick math puts the total for 2,300 kids at $38,000 each at just over $87 million. LeBron says being able to give back is the reason for what he does. Tat being able to reward hard work is important to him. While the specific criteria is still being put together, a high GPA is certainly going to be in the mix. The first class will enter the University of Akron in 2021. The post LeBron James Pledges To Cover College Tuition For 1200 Students appeared first on Jocks And Stiletto Jill .
Meridian Funds Comments on Costco August 31, 2015 | About: COST +0% Print Email Holly LaFon Articles (4159) 329 followers Follow Costco (NASDAQ:COST) operates a differentiated business model, which is membership-based warehouse clubs. The paid membership base exceeds 42 million paying households and (at $55 per year) generates $2.4 billion in annual membership fees. This revenue is visible, recurring in nature, and over time, offers significant operating leverage as Costco gradually implements fee increases. Customers sign up because they receive significant value from Costco s ability to leverage its purchasing power to offer high quality brands at discounted value. Costco has always protected its brand and reputation, and, in many ways, was the original big box to think about the strategic benefits of customer relationships as opposed to driving traffic and transaction counts. Although the stock has recently lagged the broader S&P, Costco remains a core holding of the fund. From Meridian Growth Fund's annual letter.

Burkina Faso s interim president Michel Kafando voiced reservations Monday about a regional proposal to end the crisis sparked by last week s military coup in the impoverished west African country. "I have reservations about this draft agreement" which leaves "deep-rooted problems" without solutions, he said in an interview with RFI radio. Kafando, who was detained by presidential guard officers on Wednesday, said he was "still under house arrest" and was "not a part of the negotiations" mediated by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) that came up with the 12-point plan.

Billy Welch was told to leave his gun in his car or he wouldn t be served at the Waffle House in Nicholasville, just south of Lexington. The Army National Guard soldier said he was in uniform when he stopped there with his wife early Sunday morning, Sept. 27.

DERBY head coach Paul Clement has confirmed he has enquired about Manchester United striker James Wilson. Despite selling Javier Hernandez to Bayer Leverkusen and allowing Adnan Januzaj to join Borussia Dortmund on loan, United look likely to allow Wilson - one of only four recognised forwards at Old Trafford - to leave on loan. The 36million purchase of teenager Anthony Martial from Monaco appears to be a factor in the decision. It has been reported that more than 20 clubs have enquired about the 19-year-old, who has yet to feature this season for Louis van Gaal s team and Clement has revealed the Rams are one of those. "It is a possibility but not a certainty," said Clement. "We have shown an interest. He is a very talented player and a number of other clubs have shown an interest as well. "We are waiting to hear back from Manchester United." Wilson has been frustrated by a lack of opportunities in the past year despite making a breakthrough under caretaker Ryan Giggs towards the end of the 2013-14 season. A series of niggling injuries have also stunted his progress. He has played just 17 minutes of first-team football since February and United recognise he needs more competitive games to develop.
Ahead of its release next week Activision has dropped a new video for Transformers: Devastation, one where developer Platinum Games goes into detail about the game and their design philosophy. Plus, it s another excuse to basically fawn over how good this looks. For anyone that grew up with the cartoon series, this should definitely be on your radar. From this new look we do learn that the story takes place during the never-ending war between the Autobots and the Decepticons (naturally), but this time with the evil Decepticons traveling to Earth in an attempt to Terra-form the planet into Cybertron 2.0. Of course Optimus Prime and co are having none of that nonsense and have taken it upon themselves to save the planet. [embedded content] From a combat perspective Devastation will be very different to the recent run of Transformers games that were kind of like Gears of War with Robots, and more in line with the other action titles from developer Platinum Games. This means a heavy focus on melee combat, with combos, and spectacularly over-the-top animation. A definite fit for the franchise. Transformers: Devastation is out next week, on October 6, and will be available on just about every platform.

Deflationary trend continued for the 10th month in a row with inflation plunging to a historic low of (-)4.95 percent in August on cheaper fuel and vegetables, putting pressure on RBI to cut interest rate. The Wholesale Price Index-based inflation was (-)4.05 percent in July. It has been in the negative zone since November 2014. In August 2014, inflation was 3.85 percent. However, onion and pulses turned costlier with inflation at 65.29 percent and 36.40 percent respectively during August, as per official data released on Monday. Overall, the food basket inflation remained in negative territory for second month in a row at (-)1.13 percent. For vegetables, it declined to (-)21.21 percent, helped by potato at (-)51.71 percent. Inflation rate in fuel and power segment was (-)16.50 percent, while that in manufactured products was (-)1.92 percent in August. Besides pulses and onion, the food items which became dearer in August are eggs, meat and fish (3.30 percent), milk (2.08 percent) and wheat (2.05 percent). The inflation data for June has been revised to (-)2.13 percent, as compared to provisional estimates of (-)2.40 percent. The Reserve Bank mostly tracks the Consumer Price Index- based inflation for its policy decision, and its next review is due on September 29. (Agency)
It was announced yesterday that the character of Shovel Knight (from the game with the same name) will join the ranks of video game characters who are made into Amiibos. While most Amiibos are of Nintendo created characters, a select handful (Sonic, Pac-man, and others) are of characters that have come from other companies. However all of those actual Amiibos were made by Nintendo. Shovel Knight will be the first instance where Nintendo will not be manufacturing the product, simply licensing it. Yacht Club Games will both produce and sell it, making this the first third-party Amiibo. For all those Amiibo collectors out there, does this news have any effect on whether or not you will be adding Shovel Knight to your collection when it's released? Here's the reveal trailer below: http://insidepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/shovelKnightBrandish.png

Turkish police on Tuesday used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to disperse protestors in central Istanbul, detaining over a dozen people, an AFP photographer said. Istanbul (AFP) | 1 September 2015 22:01 The rally, which gathered some 500 people, had begun peacefully at Istiklal Street in the centre of the European side of the city. Police intervened as demonstrators attempted to form a human chain and shouted slogans against the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and its offensive against Kurdish militants. Jets from a water cannon were fired down the middle of the street 〞 a busy shopping area 〞 and police used tear gas as demonstrators ran for cover. Among those detained was Yasin Akgul, a Turkish freelance photographer who works as a stringer for Agence France-Presse (AFP). He was pinned to the ground by several police as he tried to take pictures of the arrests. Akgul was taken to a waiting police van before being released after colleagues remonstrated that he was a media photographer. Akgul was given hospital treatment for an arm injury but was later allowed to go home. Reports said a cameraman from the state-run Anatolia news agency was also injured. Anatolia reported that a total of 14 people had been arrested. Turkish cities are tense as the government presses a controversial campaign against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants, with security forces clamping down on any signs of large scale protest. 2015 AFP

Justin also really enjoyed the little farmhands activity station because he got to drive a ride-on tractor!

FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) 每 Lisa Beringer lost 135 pounds training for the Fort4Fitness half marathon. She says the hardest part is keeping the weight off. Several years ago she lost 100 pounds, but gained it back. Now she has been "maintaining" her weight for the past two years. This will be her third Fort4Fitness half marathon, and she plans to do a full marathon later this year. Lisa hopes to share her motivation to be healthy with her community. She teaches boot-camp classes at the YMCA downtown. They are geared toward people of all fitness levels who are just trying to get healthy. Lisa says, "I love being able to help other people. Whether they love to run or not doesn't really matter. If they can lift a weight in the class with me, it's progress." In this year's Fort4Fitness, she will be running to support the Center for Non-Violence. We will have live coverage of Fort4Fitness during First News Saturday with live cut-ins all morning. There will also be a live stream from the finish line on wane.com. Click here to go to the live stream. Registration closes Wednesday night at 11:59. You can click here to register. Advertisement

Macho TV men are reducing female co-hosts to mere sidekicks NZ Herald 11 September 2015 Books still matter Booksellers should be thanking Family First, which is seeking a changed designation for the prize-winning book Into The River. The family values lobby group believes the book by Ted Dawe is too sexual, and has obtained the first interim ban on a book in 22 years. There is something quaint about focusing on a book, given all the sex and violence on TV, and the fact that the most illiterate teen can see any number of sexual practices online. Family First director Bob McCoskrie accepted the disparity, but said Into The River had a high profile because it won top prize in the 2013 Children's Book Awards. In my opinion that suggests the call for an age restriction is about carving a legal notch in Family First's headboard, rather than protecting impressionable young readers. But McCoskrie does have a point in insisting on a reliable certification process, so people can make an informed choice. Meanwhile, Family First is delving into the media business 每 albeit in a very limited way. Family First TV 每 available on the internet 每 is a commercial relationship with a video-on-demand firm Good TV, which provide family-friendly entertainment. Good has similar arrangements with other groups and also trades in its own right. http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11511047
New Zealand golfers Tim Wilkinson and Steven Alker are both within striking range of reclaiming their US PGA Tour cards next year after solid performances at the latest qualifying tournament in Ohio. Wilkinson finished ninth at the Nationwide Children s Hospital Championship in Columbus on one-under while Alker was a stroke back in 16th. American Andrew Loupe was a two-shot winner on five-under. Last month, both Kiwis finished outside the top 125 golfers on the US PGA Tour who automatically retain playing rights so are contesting the four-tournament qualifying series on the secondary Web.com Tour. If they can finish ranked among the top 25 of 125 golfers chasing PGA berths, they will return to the full tour in 2016. Wilkinson is making a decent fist of it, ranked 19th heading into the fourth and final tournament next week. Alker is also on the cusp, ranked 35th. Both require prominent performances at the Web.com Tour Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida starting on Thursday.
New Delhi: Ranbir Kapoor was recently EXPOSED by Deepika Padukone through a video posted by ex-flame Deepika Padukone. Ranbir was exposed in a funny sense(don't get too serious about it) She had posted a video on Facebook to show Ranbir's 'ignorance' about social media. As their upcoming movie Tamasha draws closer, Deepika probably wanted to do some funny Tamasha by posting this video. Deepika had recorded the video while the stars were promoting Tamasha. The video shows her asking Ranbir to share with the viewers the Facebook, Instagram and Twitter handles of Tamasha. Ranbir surely looks confused in the video. Watch the video to actually know how well Ranbir knows social media!
Pouncing on an opportunity to run for an open countywide seat, Eustis Mayor Michael Holland pre-filed today for Lake County supervisor of elections. Holland made his move four days after learning that longtime elections head Emogene Stegall, 89, won t seek re-election next year. "I ve truthfully been thinking about it for some time," he said. "Now was the time to do it." Stegall s decision to retire when her current term ends Jan. 2, 2017, was reported Sunday by the Orlando Sentinel. Stegall has served as elections boss since 1972 and has been with the office since 1958. Holland, a 50-year-old Republican, is the second candidate to pre-file for the contest. Another Republican, Margie Eaton, put in her paperwork to run earlier. Stegall, a Democrat, defeated Eaton in 2012 by a 54-46 percent margin. Eaton, a judicial assistant in Orlando with experience as an office manager, said it was time for new blood in the office and campaigned on a platform of making sure office equipment is updated and employees are cross-trained. She also pledged to boost community outreach. Holland has been on the Eustis City Commission for seven years. He also is a funeral director at Harden-Pauli Funeral Home in Eustis, where he said he also handles public relations. "I feel like I ve got the credentials that make me a good candidate," he said. jfallstrom@tribune.com or 352-742-5916 Copyright 2015, Orlando Sentinel

WAYNE Hemingway has criticised Darlington Borough Council for not supporting the efforts of an internationally renowned artist. The fashion designer took the authority to task during a VIP event at this weekend's Festival of Thrift. He criticised members of the council for not doing enough to ensure French artist Olivier Grossetete was supported in his creation of a five-storey cardboard clock tower. The replica of Darlington's clock tower was erected on Friday, September 27 to launch the Festival of Thrift. Its success depended on members of the public assisting with its installation and was threatened by a lack of interest. Mr Hemingway said it had proved surprisingly difficult to engage enough people to help with the project. Telling the audience he was a "glass half empty" person, he accused the council of not getting involved to the extent it could have. He said: "There were about 50 people willing to help and 30 or 40 of those were from the festival. "Every single member of the council should not have gone home that night, they should have been there. Share article "We didn't have the security there to keep it all weekend and it should have been there for people to see. "This was a chance to see an amazing sculpture from an internationally renowned artist and it was pulled down before the festival started for all the wrong reasons."
Iowa Republicans are clearly turning away from "establishment candidates." That's the finding of Craig Robinson, editor-in-chief of TheIowaRepublican.com , a widely read partisan website in the nation's first caucus state, and a new Monmouth University Polling Institute survey. The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll, released Saturday, saw Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, within 5 percentage points of front-runner Donald Trump. A Monmouth University Polling Institute survey , released Monday, had the two in a tie. "Most Iowa Republicans prefer someone without a traditional political pedigree," said a poll analysis. 23% Donald Trump and Ben Carson each have that support in the latest Monmouth University Polling Institute survey of Iowa Republicans Robinson found "the establishment is toxic," and noted that in the Register poll, candidates who have never held public office, Trump, Carson and former business executive Carly Fiorina, totaled 46 percent. Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida; Sen.
Several hundred people on eBay and Craigslist are trying to sell train tickets to the Pope s visit to Philadelphia for up to $40 -- or four times their face value. Only problem for the sellers: The tickets are not nearly sold out. The city still has about 100,000 left for sale. Pope Francis is set to be in Philly on September 26 and 27 as part of his visit to the United States and Cuba. According to a spokesperson for SEPTA, the city s commuter rail line, only about half of the available 200,000 tickets -- selling for $10 each -- have been claimed. The tickets went on sale online on July 20. Almost immediately the SEPTA site was overwhelmed with potential ticket buyers and it had to be taken down because it was running too slowly. Based on the initial response, resellers saw a money-making opportunity and SEPTA went back to the drawing board. It decided to offer the tickets through a lottery as a way to make the process more fair. However, the lottery, which began August 3, was unnecessary because many of the tickets have yet to be claimed. SEPTA figures it can carry 100,000 passengers each day -- roughly four times the usual load during the weekend. The trains will run express and only stop at selected stations. Of the available tickets, 50,000 have been claimed for Saturday and 60,000 have been claimed for Sunday. And SEPTA is wondering what happened to the initial demand. A SEPTA spokesperson urged interested travelers to visit SEPTA s website where they could pay the standard rate of $10 for the ticket.

"Pakistan has great influence in Afghanistan through the intelligence service, the ISI, but the one thing that stands in the way is the Northern Alliance," he once told me. The Northern Alliance was a collection of fighters loyal to Ahmed Shah Masoud who was fighting the Taliban. On September 9, 2011, he was murdered by a suicide bomber sent by Osama bin-Laden. The murder of Masoud, the role of Pakistan, the Taliban and 9/11 are all intertwined. Of course, it took some time for those of us who came of age on 9/11 to understand that. It's extraordinary to think back now on those days be...

CHAMPAIGN -- Republicans are hot on the trail for a candidate from Champaign County to replace retiring state Rep. Adam Brown, R-Champaign. "In my humble opinion having someone local and also being the biggest county in the district and having someone from our county is important," said Kyle Harrison, the Republican Party chairman in Champaign County. "It keeps our name, Champaign County, in the forefront. If we were one of the smaller counties it would be a tougher sell. But since we are one of the larger counties it would be good to get a representative."

Taiwan's representative to the United States, Shen Lyu-hsun, has attended a canonization ceremony led by the Pope in Washington DC. Pope Francis is currently on a US visit. At the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington DC, the pope canonized the Reverend Junipero Serra and celebrated Mass. Over 25,000 people attended the canonization ceremony, including the ambassadors of almost 50 countries. Shen was seated in the area reserved for foreign diplomats, which is significant because most countries only conduct unofficial relations with Taiwan. The Holy See is Taiwan's only full diplomatic ally in Europe.

BEIJING 〞 China s Communist Party has issued a long-awaited blueprint for overhauling bloated state industries that retains the party s dominance in the economy. The plan issued Sunday calls for state companies to be forced to compete more and become financially self-supporting. At the same time, it says the party will strengthen its leadership of state industry. The plan gives no details of how individual companies in oil, banking, energy and other state-controlled fields will be treated. The ruling party under President Xi Jinping has promised to make the slowing economy more productive by giving entrepreneurs and market forces a bigger role. But control of key industries helps the party retain its monopoly on power and the leadership faces opposition from factions that benefit from their influence over politically favored companies.

Related Business (StatePoint) College course materials can be cheaper than most college students think. Book and supplies only account for four percent of the cost of attending college among the top 10 most populous colleges and universities (using population rankings from "Forbes"). Books themselves are just a fraction of that four percent. However, during a time when many institutions are raising tuition and other fees, students are finding new ways to cut spending on these materials. Student spending on course materials this past year was an estimated 20 percent less than the 2007 to 2008 school year, according to statistics from Student Watch, developed by the National Association of College Stores. This decline can be attributed to innovative offerings from educational publishing companies, such as adaptive learning platforms, eBooks, eChapters, looseleaf editions, black-and-white editions and print-it-yourself editions. New platforms are not only helping reduce textbook prices, they are increasing student success, say experts. Digital learning presents content in more engaging and interactive ways than traditional counterparts. For more information, visit the Association of American Publishers Back to Campus website at aapbacktocampus.org. Resourceful students seeking ways to reduce the price tag associated with their degrees should think beyond scholarships and grants and take advantage of less costly course material options.
ANCHORAGE - The Russian River Ferry is shutting down a few days early. Recent high water and a damaged landing dock have put the ferry out of commission. IN THIS VIDEO: -- Ferry operators say a smaller landing dock used to unload passengers washed away in the current. No one was hurt, and the dock is secured in the river until it can be retrieved. -- The ferry was already set to close after Labor Day weekend. -- The water has been high on the Kenai River recently because of the release of a snow-glacier dammed lake in the mountains. The National Weather Service announced the flood watch for the river is upgraded to a flood advisory. It reached a minor flooding level around 1 p.m. Thursday afternoon.

Key findings from the Broadband Stakeholder Group about how SMEs will use connectivity. The Broadband Stakeholder Group commissioned the Communication Chambers to carry out a report on the broadband requirements of SMEs, defined here as businesses with up to 50 employees. The report uses a model of 2450 premises. Here are some of the key take-aways from the report. 1. Upstream demand The median upstream bandwidth demand for small businesses is set to double in the next ten years, growing from 1.3 Mbps to 2.7 Mbps. 20 percent of small business premises could be constrained by 2020 if they remain limited to today s speeds. 2. Industry variation The amount of bandwidth that businesses need varies hugely among different industries. The average premise working in food and beverage will require 57 Mbps by 2025, dwarfing the 11 Mbps required in the postal and couriers sector. 3. Downstream demand The median downstream demand for small businesses rises from 5 Mbps in 2015 to 8.1 Mbps. Considering these are smaller firms, this is in line with industry rules of thumb that allow for 1 Mbps per employee. 4. Technology Even in 2025, existing technologies such as FTTC and DOCSIS 3.0 will be sufficient for the great majority of small businesses. The rest should be served well enough by new technology such as G.Fast and DOCSIS 3.1 for many years. 5. File transfers The report revealed that file transfers were the key driver of upstream demand. In the model, doubling the size of file transfers increased demand from 42 Mbps to 74 Mbps for 95 percent of businesses.

The Incredible Instagram Account You ll Want to Follow Twice image: GeekSugar Looking at Jimmy Marble s Instagram page means treating your eyes to an explosion of happiness. The photographer, known for his colorful images, has attracted almost 74,000 followers who wait for his every post. While he does work with expensive gear and 35mm point-and-shoots, his camera of choice is his iPhone 6. "It s a piece of cake to whip it out and start shooting," he told us. "You get pictures with a lot of information that you can then play with when you re editing." That instantaneous satisfaction is why he got into photography in the first place - he used to direct short films and music videos but liked to see his work come to life much faster through photos. His style of photography is flat; flat in the sense that all the objects in the frame are in focus, much like a piece of art. And just like a good piece of art, his work is a joy to look at. Ahead, check out some of his best snaps with accompanying advice for anyone into photography. ...
Prague (AFP) - The Czech Republic said Sunday it will boost controls on the border with Austria over the refugee crisis, following a similar move by its western neighbour Germany. "The Czech Republic is boosting measures on its border with Austria. Further steps will be determined according to the number of refugees heading to the Czech Republic," Interior Minister Milan Chovanec told public Czech Television. The Czech Republic has been a transit country for migrants travelling to wealthier EU states like neighbouring Germany and registers only dozens of asylum requests within the current refugee wave. Like other ex-Communist EU members in central Europe including Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, the Czech Republic has vehemently opposed refugee redistribution under a compulsory quota system drawn up by the European Commission and pushed by EU powerhouse Germany. Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said Sunday the quota system "won t work" as migrants will want to continue to Germany or Sweden instead of staying in the poorer central European countries.

, 11:47 PM CDT Two intersections in Springfield now have flashing lights in place, replacing the traditional set up of three lights. The intersections of Second and Edwards, and Monroe and Spring are being evaluated to see if the signals should be permanently removed. Second Street and Monroe Street are now flash yellow, while Edwards and spring flash red. "Those lights mean the same thing as your yellow and red stationary lights, yellow you need to proceed into the intersection but only after giving due caution, with the flashing red you need to come to a complete stop and the proceed to the intersection when its safe," said Chris Walter of the Springfield Police Department. The signals will be monitored for 90-days before a judgement is made. A similar judgment was made earlier this week about the "disconnected intersections" on MacArthur Boulevard near Scheels.

Over the weekend Rooney Mara was honored with the Silver Medallion at the Telluride Film Festival, during a tribute to her sterling career. It s pretty amazing when you consider she s only been a seriously recognized actress since about 2009, and already she s recognized as one of the best in her field. So losing someone of her ability is a major blow to any production, and that s what director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (Me and Earl and the Dying Girl) is going to have to face with his next film, Collateral Beauty. Deadline reports Mara has dropped out of the film which has already had its share of casting problems. Hugh Jackman was the first to take on the male lead until he exited and Johnny Depp briefly considered it. Ultimately it was Will Smith who settled into the role of a depressed New York ad exec and the unusual route his colleagues take to break him out of his funk. No reason was given for Mara s departure but it may have something to do with the string of movies she recently completed. She recently completed three movies in a row, including Jim Sheridan s The Secret Scripture, and of course the awards campaign for Todd Haynes Carol is just starting to gear up.

FXStreet (Mumbai) - The cross in the EUR/JPY extends its rebound from fresh multi-month lows in the European morning and reclaimed 133 handle largely on the back of yen weakness versus the US dollar while a firmer EUR/USD also underpins. EUR/JPY driven by increasing risk-off trades Currently, the EUR/JPY pair trades 0.43% higher at 133.20, easing-off fresh session highs reached at 133.32. The EUR/JPY cross manages to recover more than half of Friday's fall and now seems poised to test 133.50 levels as renewed wave of risk-aversion is seen boosting bids for the fund currency in the euro. Looking ahead, markets now await upcoming macro releases due to released later this week as the EU calendar is almost empty today, while the US markets remain closed for the Labor Day holiday. EUR/JPY Technical Levels To the upside, the next resistance is located at 133.68 (Sept 4 High) levels and above which it could extend gains 135 levels.

The Atlanta Falcons are working on an injury settlement with Antone Smith who suffered an injured hamstring this summer. If the two sides cannot reach an agreement on a settlement, Smith will be placed on I.R. Either way the result will be, Smith will not be suiting up for the Falcons this season. In all likelihood, there will be an injury settlement at some point this season. Fantasy Analysis: Smith was the ultimate boom-or-bust home run threat last season. He averaged 6.3 yards per carry and 17.1 yards per catch. He scored five TDs on just 36 catches. The TDs were from 38, 41, 48, 54 and 74 yards. These types of big plays will likely be enough for him to latch on with somebody once he can pass a physical. However, he will turn 30 years old on September 17. This leaves Devonta Freeman as the only real option as a pass-catcher out of the backfield.
HAVANA - Agence France-Presse This September 1, 2014 file photo shows a class at Baragua school in Havana, on the first day of school in Cuba. AFP Photo Now that Cuba has restored diplomatic ties with the United States, teaching English in schools will be a priority, the communist party newspaper Granma reported on Aug. 31. In the 1970s, the study of English in Cuban schools was supplanted by Russian, after the Soviet Union emerged as the communist island s main benefactor following Fidel Castro s ascent to power in 1959. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, English returned to the Cuba s academic curriculum. And since Havana and Washington restored ties in July, interest in English has skyrocketed. "The language is essential because every day we are going to have more contact" with the United States and other countries, the communist party s number two official, Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, told university students over the weekend. In 2008, two years after yielding power to his brother Raul, Fidel Castro acknowledged the importance of speaking English. "The Russians studied English. Everyone studied English, except for us. We studied Russian," Castro said. September/01/2015 PHOTO GALLERY
A Los Angeles father who police believe stabbed his young sons to death before turning the blade on himself remains hospitalized. Los Angeles Police Officer Matthew Ludwig said Thursday that the man is still in the hospital and will be arrested if he survives his wounds. His name hasn t been released. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County Coroner s Office identified his three children as 8-year-old Alexander Fuentes, 9-year-old Juan Fuentes and 10-year-old Luis Fuentes. A furniture store owner found the boys bodies in the back of an SUV early Wednesday morning. Their father was in the front seat bleeding from stab wounds to his chest. A knife was in the passenger seat. Ludwig says detectives believe the father is the one who killed the boys, and there are no other suspects.
I m a huge proponent of adopting Senior Pets. Everyone deserves a second chance at life and seniors have so much love to give and so much life to share. After loving unconditionally, they often lose their home through no fault of their own. They are usually overlooked and are the first to be killed in a shelter. That s a huge price to pay for being a loving companion. Many times they are the victims of the death of their owner, or their owner having to go into a nursing home. Family members will often swoop in, take whatever "possessions" they want and throw the beloved pet out of the house or into a shelter. It s horrible enough that they have lost their human but they lose their home. I ve written about this before and discussed preventing this from happening but too many people don t make provisions for the companion in their will and arrange a new home well in advance "just in case..." Why should you adopt a Senior Dog? This video from HooplaHa will both show and tell you why...

The number of tourists who visited Tunisia reached 3 million at the end of August 2015, i.e. down almost one million tourists compared to the same period in 2014, Minister of Tourism, Salma Rekik Elloumi said, Thursday, September 3, 2015, in an interview with Mosaiquefm. The minister added that the tourism sector has been in crisis since 2010 which worsened with the Revolution in 2011 with the number of tourists visiting Tunisia declining over 50%. On the other hand, she said his Ministry is working to change the image of Tunisia abroad and plans to open new markets like China and India to attract a new category of tourists. After last June 26 terrorist attack in a hotel located in the tourist resort of El Kantaoui, Sousse, many European tour operators have canceled thousands of intended stays in Tunisia and some Tunisian hotels have closed doors following the drop in tourist arrivals.

WASHINGTON, Sept 10 (KUNA) -- Cyber threats to the US national and economic security are increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication and the severity of impact, said Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Thursday. "Our primary concern is the low-to moderate-level cyber-attacks from a variety of sources, which will continue and probably expand. This imposes increasing costs, as you indicate, to our businesses, to US economic competitiveness, and to national security," Clapper noted during at the Congress. "Because of our heavy dependence on the Internet, nearly all information communications technology and IT networks and systems will be perpetually at risk. These weaknesses provide an array of possibilities for nefarious activity by cyber threat actors," he told the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. He added that "these cyber threats come from a range of actors, including nation states, which fall into, at least in my mind, two broad categories. Those with highly sophisticated cyber programs -- most notably Russia and China -- those with lesser technical capabilities but more nefarious intent, such as Iran or North Korea, who are also more aggressive and more -- and more unpredictable. "In the future, I believe we ll see more cyber operations that will change or manipulate electronic information to compromise its integrity. In other words, compromise its accuracy and its reliability instead of merely deleting it or disrupting access to it. "Until such time as we do create both the substance and the mindset of deterrence, this sort of thing is going to continue," Clapper said. (end) yt.hb

Van Nicholas also presented its new 650b plus hardtail - the Revelstoke, which has been designed to accommodate 3in tyres but doubles up as a 29er. The Revelstoke built for Eurobike also featured an exciting prototype fork. The single-sided, dual-crown rigid unit was, naturally for Van Nicholas, produced from titanium and is likely to end up a production item.

NEW YORK (MainStreet) 〞 Hotel room prices around the globe are on the rise, with some of the highest spikes taking place in North America and the United States, but it s also bargain time for a few of the world s hottest destinations - such as New York, London and Paris. A recent report from Hotels.com showed that the nightly cost of a room in North America increased 4% during the first half of 2015, and in the U.S. in particular, the price jump averaged around 3%. The increases in the U.S., though not dramatic, are being triggered by the relative strength of the economy and a record high in domestic spending, says Taylor Cole, of Hotels.com. "Domestic spending was at an all time high during the second quarter of 2015, which is having an impact on hotel prices," says Cole. Even more notable, however, is that amid a global wave of increases, the hotel room prices in some of the country s and the world s most popular markets are bucking the trend, heading in the opposite direction. In New York City, typically one of the more expensive destinations for travelers, hotel room rates are down 6%. In London, another perennial favorite among travelers, prices are down 7%, according to the Hotels.com report. And Paris, home of all things luxurious and glamorous, is witnessing a 16% drop in hotel prices. There are a variety of reasons behind the price drops in cities such as New York, Paris and London.
STUART Heath says the Magpies must play to their strengths before worrying about Cirencester's in tonight's FA Cup replay at the Corinium Stadium (7.＃ STUART Heath says the Magpies must play to their own strengths before worrying about Cirencester's in tonight's FA Cup replay at the Corinium Stadium (7.45pm). Defender Chris Dillon is again set to miss out with a groin problem but first-team coach Heath insists Dorchester face the Centurions with "real confidence ". The sides could not be separated at the end of 90 minutes on Saturday, with Charlie Griffin cancelling out Jake Smeeton's opener for Mark Jermyn's men. And both teams now know that they will face a trip to Petersfield Town, conquerors of Weymouth, in the second qualifying round next weekend. Looking at tonight's tie, Heath said: "We've got to make sure we play our game, better than we did on Saturday.

Suzuki Motorcycles India has just launched the refreshed Let's scooter in India at Rs 56,417 (on-road Mumbai). The changes are purely cosmetic to keep the little scooter relevant and tackle the likes of the Honda Activa i and the Yamaha Ray Z. The refreshed Let's gets new dual tone colour scheme and racy graphics that adds some pizzazz to the otherwise bland body panels on the previous version. The new colours include Matte Grey with Matte Black, Pearl Suzuki Blue with Matte Black and Pearl Mira Red with Matte Black.

The government is going to increase allowance for freedom fighters by 60 percent to make it Tk 8,000 monthly per person. The decision was taken last week in a meeting of social safety net with Finance Minister AMA Muhith in the chair. A finance ministry official said a circular would be issued very soon in this regard. Currently, a freedom fighter gets Tk 5,000 as allowance per month. In June, Muhith in his budget speech for the current fiscal year (FY) said Tk 10,000 a month as allowance would be given to a freedom fighter aged above 65. After the finance minister s announcement, on behalf of the freedom fighters it was said freedom fighters below the age of 65 were small in number. So, the facility for all freedom fighters should be same. The official said now it was decided that from July 1, all freedom fighters would get monthly allowance of Tk 8,000. From the next FY, they each would receive Tk 10,000 as allowance. At present, around 2 lakh freedom fighters receive allowance from the government budget for which Tk 2,000 crore has been allocated in the current FY budget. The official said if each freedom fighter was given Tk 8,000 as allowance, the allocation would cover the rising demand of money.

The province will gives grants to business owners who want to turn their under-utilized upper stories into residential space. Brandon Mayor Rick Chrest says initiatives such as these go a long way to restore the downtown area. "It s a very big challenge and it looks very overwhelming to most of us but the only way to make progress is one step at a time," said Chrest. The grant will cover 50 per cent of project costs of up to $175,000 dollars, per property and owner. The support in total adds up to $400,000 and will be delivered by the city and Renaissance Brandon. Share Comment
(Before It s News) Originally published on LonelyConservative.com Hillary Clinton came out in support of President Obama's miserable deal with Iran. She likes it so much she said she'll go to war to enforce it . Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday declared her support for President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran but pledged to back up the deal with the threat of military action, subtly breaking with the president she served as secretary of state. "I will not hesitate to take military action if Iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon," Mrs. Clinton said in a speech at the Brookings Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington. The tough stance was a departure from Mr. Obama, who has said that military options would only be a last resort. ( Read More ) At least she's threatening someone besides employers.

Internet shoegaze sensations and fans of a forced pun, Elvis Depressedly (they have a song titled, wittily, 'Disgraceland') have released their first full album New Alhambra on free music streaming site Bandcamp as a pay-as-you-want download. Though their name may be a little awkward, it is apt: they combine the hope and tackiness of the American Dream with low-fi guitar loops and echoic, melancholic vocals. They describe the LP as an "end times prophecy"; it has the sound of a dissociated, doomed youth, making it the perfect soundtrack for glum Midwestern teens smoking in car parks at night and staring forlornly at the stars. This album draws on the culture in which Elvis Depressedly feel lost; "rock n' roll" is a pastiche of one of the King himself's finest, most overwrought ballads, and their low-fi recording techniques and disaffected air show the clear influence of their grunge predecessors. However, unlike grunge their overriding emotion is not anger but apathy: "It's a sad world/we were raised in/you could hate it/but what's the use?" laments album closer 'Wastes of Time', perfectly summarising their outlook in the strange, dissatisfying world of the American south. Elvis Depressedly sing with frankness and create an atmospheric portrait of youthful apathy, and if that sounds like your thing I thoroughly suggest sending a few quid their way.

SCOTT Morrison says he will consult widely in coming weeks as he puts together his first mid-year budget review and responds to a series of reviews, including the tax white paper. IN his first statement after being sworn in as treasurer on Monday, Mr Morrison said the Turnbull government would aim to provide economic opportunity and security for Australian families. It is also his ambition to drive the confidence necessary for growth. "Central to this confidence is jobs," he said. Mr Morrison said it was the government s duty to taxpayers to manage the nation s public finances, while continuing to steadily reduce the budget deficit and the debt burden. "It is a great privilege and exciting responsibility to be taking on the role of treasurer and I thank the prime minister for putting his confidence in me," the former social services minister said. Mr Morrison acknowledged the work and dedication of his predecessor Joe Hockey, and particularly Mr Hockey s leadership during Australia s presidency of the G20 in 2014. The former treasurer s legacy was "strong and worthy", he said, and represented a turning point in the nation s finances. In his last act as treasurer, Mr Hockey released the final budget outcome for the 2014/15 financial year, which recorded a deficit of $37.9 billion - a $3.3 billion improvement compared with the estimate at the time of the 2015/16 budget release in May. Mr Hockey announced on Sunday that he would be leaving parliament.

Posted Tuesday, September 8th 2015 @ 1pm by Rob Quinn, Newser Staff ( NEWSER ) 每 A flight attendant who stopped serving passengers alcohol after she converted to Islam says things were going perfectly until a colleague complained. Charee Stanley says that after she found out that her faith didn t allow her to serve booze, her supervisor at ExpressJet suggested that she work out an arrangement with other flight attendants to handle alcohol requests, CNN reports. But after the complaint was received, the airline ditched its religious accommodation, placed Stanley on 12-month unpaid leave, and told her she could be fired when the year was up, according to a lawyer for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

AIM Network Tuesday 8th September, 2015 Why do people stay in abusive relationships? What are the warning signals that it is time to walk away?? How many chances do you give a partner, or a government, to hurt you? Psychological abuse occurs when a person in the relationship tries to control information available to another person with intent to manipulate that person s sense of reality or their view of what is acceptable and unacceptable. It seems to me that is exactly what our government is doing with regard to asylum seekers. Psychological abuse often contains strong emotionally manipulative content and threats design...

Like a mashed up quote from the lyrics of our national anthem, indeed yesterday mornings launch of an Atlas rocket into space looked, like the spectacle the song depicts, simply awesome. (Re-reading the above "sentence." Talk about a convoluted mash up.) I snapped this pic with my phone as the plume flared up in the sky behind the Maple Building on campus. It completely was happenstance that I witnessed this launch as I hadn t known beforehand that it was scheduled. I just happened to be facing east while out doing Synthroids at 6:20am. The cheap camera on my phone produces poorer quality pics than we see in these photos though: Very awesome sight though and it happens to be during a coincidentally space-themed phase I m in lately, spending almost all hours of every day either playing "Elite: Dangerous" or binge-watching "Star Trek: The Next Generation" episodes. All this space shit inspired me to change my Facebook, Google+, and YouTube profile pic/avatar to this:

The figure is well above the London average of 3.01 and higher than neighbouring boroughs Bromley (2.79) and Bexley (3.13). Despite more Londoners reporting "very low" levels of anxiety and fewer reporting "high anxiety", the average rating in the captial remains higher than they UK average of 2.86. Greenwich also rated below the London average in the areas of life satisfaction, happiness and the feeling that what one does in life is worthwhile. Overall, the figures show that Londoners personal well-being levels have improved since 2012 but still remain lower than those of people in other parts of the country. Share article Glenn Everett, director of well-being at the Office for National Statistics, said: "We often talk of how the country is doing, usually in economic terms. Today's figures address how people are feeling about their lives. "Overall, people are generally rating their lives higher than they did four years ago."

A man who headed a Blackpool law firm has been jailed for six years for stealing 223,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. David Barrowclough, 48, made up archeological digs which then applied to the fund for grant aid. But the excavation sites listed by Cambridge don Barrowclough, never existed. Barrowclough, now of Broad Street, Ely, was jailed for six years and Huntington Crown Court heard how he had spent the money on property, Premium Bonds and a new Alfa Romeo car. The academic was charged with nine counts of fraud and one count of obtaining property by deception. He denied all charges but was found guilty of all but one. It's understood the fraud came to light when museum staff were delivered a letter to Barrowclough confirming a grant for 18,500 每 but they were unaware of the project it was designated for and called in police. Barrowclough has paid back more than 70,000 to the Heritage Lottery Fund, which said it will pursue the rest of the fraudulently-obtained cash. The court heard that Barrowclough had become a don at Wolfson College, Cambridge, but never told the college about a previous conviction for theft. He completed a PHD at Wolfson after he failed to reveal that when he had a law firm on Adelaide Street, Blackpool he stole money from its client account and legal aid account. As a result he was struck off the solicitors' role and served four years' jail.

He s appearing in HBO s upcoming adaptation of All The Way , where Bryan Cranston will reprise his Tony-winning performance as Lyndon B. Johnson. Whitford will be playing Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Presumably, Whitford is keeping a lid (literally) on his new do for the role.

This is a major update to the popular Equity Mutual Fund Portfolio Comparison Tool. The biggest limitation of working with Value Research was that the entire portfolio was not compared. Now the sheet uses the entire portfolio listed at Moneycontol to make the comparison. Use the excel tool to compare mutual fund stock holdings and determine the extent of portfolio overlap among your mutual fund holdings. The tool can help you build a well-diversified equity portfolio. I have checked it with equity funds and balanced funds. I have not yet checked it with debt funds. Note: Just because there is large overlap among your funds, you don't need to press the panic button and make changes to your portfolio. If you think a change is needed, make it gradually.

The Business Council and other business groups 每 the ACTU, the Australian Council of Social Service, KPMG, The Australian Financial Review and The Australian 每 came together at the summit two weeks ago to try and revive public policy reform in the absence of political leadership.

The executive board at Brazilian mining company Vale, the world s largest producer of iron ore and pellets, said it planned to ask the board of directors to cut the 2015 dividend payout by $500 million. Management wants to pay shareholders $500 million in the second installment of the 2015 dividend, or half of what was initially planned, Vale said in a statement. The reduced payout is in line with "the more uncertain scenario for mineral commodities prices and the focus on managing the balance sheet," Vale said. "If the proposal is approved by the board of directors, Vale will have distributed to its shareholders US$ 1.5 billion in 2015, including the payment of the first dividend installment of US$ 1 billion on April 30, 2015," Vale said.

Borussia Moenchengladbach have appointed reserve team coach Andre Schubert as an interim successor to Lucien Favre who resigned on Sunday after the team began the Bundesliga season with five straight defeats. Gladbach Sports Director Max Eberl told reporters the club had been caught by surprise after the Swiss coach, who led them to a third-place finish last season, resigned despite efforts by club officials to change his mind. The 44-year-old Schubert is a former German national youth team coach and has also worked at Paderborn and St Pauli in lower divisions but has never coached a Bundesliga team before. Favre, who had been in charge since 2011 and lifted the club from the brink of relegation to third place and a maiden Champions League group stage spot, left a day after their 1-0 loss in the Rhine derby against Cologne.

BONKERS TOWN 〞 We all like to pretend like we re totally fearless, don t act like it s not true. You brag about that time you stood up to that terrifying dog, the time you braved those sketchy streets at night to get to that exclusive party or the time you spent the night in that haunted house. When you dig a little deeper you realize all of those tales of heroism are just based on true stories. That vicious dog was a Pomeranian who happened to yelp a little as you cowered, that sketchy street was in Millcreek and that exclusive party was actually a Del Taco and that haunted house was actually your in-laws and you just don t get along with them. We all like to act tough, and some of us are, but I m not sure any of us are quite as tough and brave as Laso Schaller . First off, his name is awesome; secondly, he just broke the world record for highest cliff jump . The Brazilian-born and Swiss-raised Schaller jumped from a platform 59 meters high 〞 that s 193.57 feet for us Americans 〞 and hit a top speed of 123 km/h. Again, for us Yanks that s over 76 mph. The video is insane and my heart started pumping just watching Schaller jump. I think that means this stunt was incredibly impressive and I need to get out of the house more often.

A JURY was unable to make a unanimous decision on whether Paul Gathercole intended to murder his flatmate Coffs Harbour man Robert "Robbie" Joseph Charles. The trial for came to an end this week but after about two days deliberating, the jury informed the judge they were unable to make a unanimous decision. The jury was then dismissed. Mr Gathercole was accused of murdering Mr Charles, who was found sprawled out the front of a unit on the Gold Coast in 2014 after being stabbed in his stomach. During the trial, evidence emerged that Mr Gathercole had admitted to police that he had "stabbed my best mate". The jury heard during the trial that Mr Gathercole could not remember the alleged stabbing; only that he had lost his temper. The jury was asked to determine whether Mr Gathercole was guilty of intending to kill Mr Charles or cause him grievous bodily harm. The case remains before the Brisbane Supreme Court. - APN NEWSDESK
File Photo (Photo: KARE) CHANHASSEN, Minn. - Authorities say synthetic drugs could be the cause of a 17-year-old s death, after he was found face-up in a marsh having a seizure. The 17-year-old boy, identified as Alexander Snyder, of Chanhassen, was initially reported missing by his family. When police came to investigate, Snyder s father said he used a tracking app to find his son s cell phone, which led to a location at the Regional Park. That s where the father found his son s cell phone and his shoes. A deputy arrived on scene and eventually found Snyder, who was in a cattail marsh, face up in 3-4 inches of water. Snyder seemed to be suffering a seizure, according to the deputy. He was brought to the shore, where paramedics gave him CPR, before being transported to 212 Medical Center in Chaska. Snyder was then taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where he died on Sept. 29. While investigating his death, the Carver County Sheriff s Office learned another teen from Chanhassen was with Snyder before he disappeared. The boy said he and Snyder took a synthetic psychedelic drug they bought over the internet from China. The other teen said he was starting to experience effects from the drug and was transported to 212 Medical Center for treatment. He was later released. Snyder s death remains under investigation.

George Perduta of Kensington had taken the 17 year-old girl to dinner in April and the student later told police that his questions during the meal had made her uncomfortable. After dinner, Perduta went to kiss her on the lips but she moved her head down and he kissed her on the forehead, police said. Perduta was arrested Tuesday on a warrant charging him with disorderly conduct and released after posting a $500 bond. He will be arraigned Sept. 22 in Derby Superior Court.
"Girl Waits With Gun: A Novel" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt), by Amy Stewart One of the nation s first female deputy sheriffs got her unexpected start when a car rammed into her horse-drawn buggy, upending her quiet farm life. This is the true-life backdrop of the new novel "Girl Waits With Gun" by Amy Stewart, author of the best-seller "The Drunken Botanist." The book is set in New Jersey in 1914 and follows Constance Kopp as she tries to recover damages from the driver, a surly factory owner who sent threatening letters warning her to back off. As the situation escalated, shots were fired at the house that she and her sisters lived in, and the local sheriff deemed it prudent to give them revolvers to protect themselves. The yearlong saga gives Kopp "the realization that we have to be a part of the world in which we live. We don t scurry away when we re in trouble, or when someone else is. We don t run and hide." Well-written with sharply drawn characters and the occasional plot twist, "Girl Waits With Gun" is an absorbing throwback to a bygone era. The story does lag at times and one wishes it explored Kopp s experience in the pioneering job, an area left completely untouched by the author. Quibbles aside, it s a solid book, and Stewart s helpful notes allow readers to appreciate just how much of the tale is true. ___ Online: http://www.amystewart.com/ fab!!
Orakei Local Board member Ken Baguley, board chair Desley Simpson, village resident Brian Smith, village manager Dean Jackson and village residents Pauline Reynolds, Laurie Campbell, Shirley Campbell and Geraldine Taylor. The Orakei Local Board has come to the rescue of its elderly neighbours. A new fence has been installed between the road and footpath on Abbotts Way in Remuera after elderly residents complained about their safety. The fence will provide safer access for residents at the Edmund Hillary Retirement Village when they walk to Lunn Ave shops. Village resident Laurie Campbell has been campaigning for a barrier along the street for more than three years. "I thought it was dangerous the way the traffic was booming around there," he says. "I thought someone would be cleaned out." Village manager Dean Jackson says cars race around the corner onto Abbotts Way to get through the traffic lights. He says the fence will improve safety for residents both walking and using mobility scooters. The Orakei Local Board advocated for Auckland Transport to install the fence, despite it not being within the board s area. Local Board member and project lead Ken Baguley says they had to ignore the fact that the boundary between Orakei and Maungakiekie-Tamaki Local Boards goes through the road. "Safety for residents is the driver for this project especially since many of them have been ratepayers in the Or芋kei Local Board area for years," he says. "We felt it needed to be done for the common good so we went ahead a did it."
Pune: The Pune airport is all set for a makeover. Now that the current Pune-Mumbai Expressway mess is unable to divert much traffic towards Mumbai, frequent flyers are growing in numbers at the city airport. Keeping this and the future possibilities of more flyers in mind, the Airport Advisory Committee (AAC) has made a five-year development plan (DP) for the airport. This plan envisions an independent civil airport by introducing additional commuter facilities, international flights as well as cargo facilities. The committee is expected to submit the DP to the Pune Airport Authority at its next meeting. Private players stand to gain much from this exercise. Manoj Mittal, manager, Air India, Pune station, said, "We are getting an overwhelming response for the Pune-Dubai flight. Every flight is seated to capacity now. Pune is an IT hub, so there has always been a demand for international flights. Owing to the current constraints of the Pune-Mumbai Expressway, people now prefer to take their flight from Pune. But, in the current restrictions on the Pune airport, it is difficult to get the slot. The Ministry of Defence will have to sort out the issue. The AAC and its chairman, Anil Shirole, are very enthusiastic about making this into a full-fledged airport with all modern amenities." 07/09/15 Sukrit Gumaste/Pune Mirror

Hi everyone! This is a clean and simple card I created for the local humane society. The card base is dark brown cardstock. On it I layered blue cardstock embossed using the Darcie Paw Prints embossing folder then sanded it down to show the white core of the cardstock. I used vintage photo distress ink on the edges. I wrapped white crochet thread around the cardstock before adhering it to the card base. The shadow layer is a light brown cardstock. I punched the corners using a corner punch then distressed the edges. Between the shadow layer and the image I added a strip of dark brown cardstock and using a pair of scissors cut banners at both ends. The image was die cut using one of the labels dies and the edges are distressed with vintage photo distress ink. Thanks for stopping by... hope you have a purr-fect day!

By Saul Cooke-Black THIS week the SNJ looks back at how everyone from firefighters to musicians rallied together to help those affected by the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004. A Sri Lankan man who lived in Stroud was raising money for a housing project. Lakshman Gallage, who ran Snax 24 at the BP garage in London Road, raised 1,750 in just three days. "I did not think there would be so much of a reaction," he told the SNJ in January 2005. "We raised enough for three houses in three days." "Everybody is doing something. It is amazing." Mr Gallage had spoken to architects in Sri Lanka to draw up plans for simple, one-bedroomed houses, which would cost around 670 each to build. He was hoping to raise enough to build at least 10 of the homes, after seeing pictures of the disaster sent from his brother in Galle. An appeal by Stroud firefighters for money towards the disaster raised 15,000 in Stroud alone, and 125,000 across the county. Share article Andy Dunn, a Stroud musician who survived the Sri Lankan tsunami disaster, raised 300 in just under an hour and a half by busking on the High Street. Singers from three Stroud groups put on an impromptu performance outside Waitrose, collecting more than 1,200 while the organisers of the Stroud and District Charity Football Cup made a 1,000 donation.

Agartala, Sep 18 (PTI) A special meeting of the NITs of the north eastern region would be convened soon to discuss the problems and opportunities for their improvement in the region, HRD Minister Smriti Irani today said. "I am sure the interactions of the NITs in the region would not only be beneficial for the students of the region, but the NITs of the country as a whole," she said in her brief speech at a function at the NIT Agartala campus. The Minister also directed the NIT authorities of Agartala to invite at least one foreign academician in the institute for delivering lectures and teach the students at least for 15 days and furnish a list of foreign academicians to the ministry. "The cost of travel of the academicians would be borne by the ministry and the lectures would be video recorded for future use by the students," she said. She also stressed on the need for student exchange with the other NITs of the country for benefit of the students. Irani said students of all NITs should participate in the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan programme for imparting education to the students of at least five panchayat areas adjacent to the institute.
2:43 p.m. CDT By Susan Cooper Eastman JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (Reuters) - A north Florida man arrested for plotting to detonate a pressure-cooker bomb at a Kansas City memorial to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was ordered to remain in custody during a federal court appearance in Jacksonville on Tuesday. U.S. Magistrate Judge James Klindt ordered Joshua Ryne Goldberg, 20, examined for competency to stand trial at the request of Goldberg's attorney. Goldberg, 20, was arrested last week on charges of distributing information relating to explosives, destructive devices and weapons of mass destruction. His arrest was announced a day before the 14th anniversary of the attacks. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison, the Justice Department said. The criminal complaint said Goldberg distributed information to an FBI informant on how to manufacture a bomb and instructed the informant to make a pressure-cooker bomb and fill it with nails, metal and other items dipped in rat poison. Klindt said Goldberg will remain in federal custody at least until a competency hearing, which he predicted would take place within the next 60 days. Goldberg's shoulder-length brown hair was knotted and disheveled as he sat in an orange prison jumpsuit at the defense table next to his attorney, Paul Shorstein. Klindt also asked Goldberg's jailers to reexamine the antidepressant medications that Goldberg is taking. (Reporting by Susan Cooper Eastman; Editing by David Adams and Eric Beech)

Hearthstone turns aren't supposed to take more than a few seconds. In fact, that's part of the game's appeal. It's something you can log into, play a few quick games and then go on about your day. But every once in a while, a combination of cards come along that when used together create a scenario where you could walk away, make a sandwich and still be back in time to see the end of the turn. This is one of those times. What you see here is a battle between YouTuber The Optimistic Brit and a friend where two cards 〞 the Knife Juggler and the Dreadsteed dominate gameplay for about 16 minutes. The Dreadsteed is a new card added in the most recent expansion and while it deals only 1 HP, it respawns upon death. The Knife Juggler deals 1 damage to a random enemy after a minion is summoned. The result? A never-ending spree of 1 point damage and new summons. The post Two Hearthstone Cards Equal One Ridiculously Long Turn appeared first on Gamebreaker .

WELLINGTON, Sept 10 New Zealand s central bank said on Thursday that a big slowdown in China s economy or a major El Nino weather event could have a negative impact on the New Zealand economy. "Conditions that probably would be needed to create a recession in New Zealand would be something like China slowing dramatically or perhaps moving into a recession," RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler told reporters. "Also, if the El Nino really took hold and continued into the middle of next year or there abouts, that could have significant effect as well." Wheeler s comments came after the RBNZ cut its official cash rate to 2.75 percent earlier in the day. (Reporting by Charlotte Greenfield and Naomi Tajitsu ; Editing by Lincoln Feast)

DULUTH, Minn. -- Former Canadian women s hockey team coach Shannon Miller and two other former University of Minnesota Duluth female coaches are planning a news conference to talk about possible legal action relating to discrimination. Miller has alleged discrimination based on her gender and sexual orientation. After leading the Bulldogs to five NCAA national championships, the university cited a budget deficit when it informed her in December that her contract would not be renewed. Jen Banford was also released as the team s director of hockey operations. She was offered a one-year contract to remain women s softball coach, but declined. Head women s basketball coach Annette Wiles resigned in June after seven seasons, citing an unhealthy work environment. The university released a statement from Chancellor Lendley Black which says it has done an internal review of complaints raised and it disputes broad claims of discrimination.
Southampton are set to offer Ronald Koeman a new contract to ward off potential interest from the Dutch FA and rival clubs. Koeman signed a three-year deal when he was appointed in the summer of 2014 and remains happy at St Mary s, but the recent speculation about a return to the Netherlands to manage the national team has stirred the Saints hierarchy into action. They want Koeman to commit himself to the club on a longer contract that would make it virtually impossible for the Dutch FA [KNVB] to lure him away. The ex-Feyenoord boss was on their shortlist to replace Louis van Gaal last summer and only took the Southampton post once Guus Hiddink had been chosen instead. However, the national team s results have nosedived in the past 12 months, with Koeman s name now being put forward as a long-term solution, despite denials from the KNVB over rumours that incumbent Danny Blind could be about to lose his job. Bookmakers slashed their odds on Koeman being the next Premier League manager to go last week, but they have since drifted back to their previous mark. That could be a indication that Koeman, who is also admired by Barcelona and Liverpool, is in talks over a longer deal with a significant pay-rise.

Hello friends! Since we are talking about water, I thought I would share silly photo of me. This was taken in Geiranger, Norway. I had so much fun posing with the beautiful waterfalls. My kids were embarrassed. Speaking of water, I have been taking Watercolor Cards Made Simple ( taught by the talented Deepti Malik) over Craftsy. In Lesson 4, Deepti showed us how to use watercolor to create the Bokeh Effect. I had made cards with Bokeh Effect before, not never thought of using watercolors! Ding! You can see how I created this card simple by looking at the supply list. I added a bit of my own twist to this technique. I used the pattern paper (for the pop-up balloon) from Simon Says Stamp September Card kit for. I used the silver gel pen and silver Stickles for the extra shine for the accent of the balloon. Lastly, Craftsy is having a Flash Sale ( many classes are $20 and under!!). I am also taking Lovely Layers from Top to Bottom from the talented Shari Carroll over Craftsy) If you are a Shari s fan, you should totally check it out. Dr. John s travel post is coming up next!

AMHERST 每 Three years ago, Matt Haskins was looking a female with long hair willing to have the name "Matt s Barber Shop" cut into her hair to promote the barbershop on its fifth anniversary. The reward was 52 haircuts or the financial equivalent. Then 8-year-old Audrey Davis-Brand, who was waiting for her brother Cole who was getting his haircut, overheard the offer and volunteered. At first Haskins said he was hesitant to have her cut into her lovely long hair but she convinced him. She wanted to donate the money to the Dakin animal shelter. They decided to make Audrey s Day a tradition. "Audrey s the coolest kid," ever he said. On Saturday, Davis-Brand, who s now 11, and Haskins baked cupcakes they were selling and the Haskins was donating 10 percent of the day s gross sales to this year s cause - raising money and awareness about bats and white-nose syndrome. The disease has killed millions of bats since it was first discovered in New York in 2006, according to a press release from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Hadley. Haskins says he has customers who work at the service and they brought in information about the fungal disease that affects hibernating bats. Davis-Brand loves animals. She has two cats, a dog, bearded dragon, guinea pig and a frog. The sixth grader at Wildwood Elementary School would like to do something with animals when she gets older. They raised about $250 last year for the turtle cause last year. Davis-Brand said she as hoping the day would raise even more. 
0 Sleazy photoshoot with a Haval H9 goes Wrong Published on September 1, 2015 by Tycho de Feijter A local Haval dealer in the great city of Shantou in Guangdong Province had a brilliant idea: take some babe and a Haval H9 to the beach for a sleazy photoshoot with the waves and the birds. Dealers in China take their liberties when it comes to promotion, and car makers are powerless to stop them. But what about the sand..? Well, the sand was a bitch, grabbing the heavy H9 by its tires and just sucking it in, with the tide rising and the sky darkening. The pretty girls have disappeared here from the story, likely gone swimming gone home or gone to school. Beach boys and the photo team tried to get the H9 out. But it is a big and heavy car, not a chance against the southern sands, no matter the fancy four wheel drive and the turbocharged 218hp four-cylinder petrol engine. Bigger wheels might have helped though! Look that photo man wearing hipster shoes, dirty 'em good sand! And as always; the harder they try the harder the car sinks. Fortunately the tide didn't get the poor Haval because an excavator was called in for some professional pulling, and finally got the H9 on safer grounds. Next photoshoot in a park in town, we bet.

:33 The two countries have been locked in a border conflict for a month, after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordered the closure of part of the frontier, saying some of his military were attacked during an anti-smuggling operation by Colombian paramilitaries. Ahead of Friday's crash, the Venezuelan plane was chasing an "illicit aircraft that entered the northwestern part of the country (Venezuela) headed south toward the border with Colombia", Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said in a statement. He said "gangs in the area are trying to use our territory to traffic drugs produced in Colombia to Central America and the Caribbean." Lopez's ministry said it was launching a search for the pilots and was investigating the causes of the accident. In a tweet, Maduro expressed "all the support and solidarity of the country for the Bolivarian Military Aviation, lift up the morale and continue the fight." Venezuela has stepped up its military presence over the past month. Maduro has also ordered the deportation of some 1,500 Colombians, while about 20,000 others have fled out of fear of being expelled, unleashing a major diplomatic crisis. Maduro and his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos will meet in Quito on Monday to try to resolve the border conflict. 2015 AFP

Detectives working on the disappearance of William Tyrrell say his suspected kidnapper would have taken tremendous risks. There was only a narrow window of opportunity to take William, said Dr Sarah Yule, NSW Police Force s senior forensic psychologist, in comments released on Sunday. A year after the then three-year-old disappeared from his grandmother s frontyard in Kendall on NSW s mid-north coast, the psychological profiler is trying to get inside the mind of his suspected abductor. The area where William vanished is on the edge of the township near a dead-end street, Yule added. So if no one but Williams parents and grandmother knew in advance of his visit to Kendall, then you would have to have some other reason to be there and take that opportunity; either visiting, residing or working in the vicinity. Detective Inspector Jubelin, who s heading the investigation, said the inclusion of a behavioural specialist on the strike force had been invaluable. In cases like these we need to get into the headspace of the person who took William, why they did it, what makes them tick, he said. The kidnapping occurred on a Friday around 10.30am. It was broad daylight and whoever abducted him risked being seen from the balcony of William s grandmother s home as well as neighbouring properties, he continued. Police were appealing for new information on the case a day after more than 2000 people marched through Kendall to raise awareness of William s disappearance. AAP
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (WLFI) 〞 NASA administrator Charles Bolden visited Purdue Friday to help the university announce the Purdue Systems Collaboratory. The PSC is expected to demonstrate how to see beyond a technical solution through research and student learning opportunities. It focuses on the human element to solve problems such as natural disaster recovery, transportation and power resources. It will be available to both Purdue graduate students and undergraduates as a concentration or minor. Purdue's head professor in the school of industrial engineering said the collaboratory will integrate many different majors and give students a competitive edge. Bolden said it's important for students to look at problems from every angle. "We are really trying to help young engineers understand that there is more to life than just designing a system," said Bolden. "You've got to be able to communicate the importance of that system, you've got to be able to work external to the engineering world." Bolden says NASA is closer than ever to landing humans on Mars, and credits Purdue with a lot of NASA's success. He said he wouldn't be surprised if the person who lands on Mars is a Purdue graduate. Friday marked the official launch of the PSC. The collaboratory plans to host several seminars and events in the future.

The Ice Cream Truck She heard the Ice cream truck Singing passed her. It trembled into the distance Dragging her memory along To her childhood. She heard the ice cream truck When she was two, On the first day she was told that he loved her. On the first day she clasped her hand Around her chest, To feel a quick conversation She had with her heart. She heard the ice cream truck When he walked away, Into the distance. And all she heard Was the sound. Lingering. She heard the ice cream truck, When she was nine. He held her hand, Merried across the pavement, She tripped. Her knee teared. Bleeding down a road. The sound followed. She heard the ice cream truck, In the late night Of her first cigarette, Seventeen horror movies after the first of many men that rejected her. She was too woman to kill her cigarette. Rather, cremated her memories, Stomped the ashes and let her thoughts blow with the wind. She hears the ice cream truck. Singing passed her. She teared, Down a road that led to an old conversation Her heart once felt. She stomped her cigaretteInstead, creating her memories And let her thoughts drift with the wind.

PHILADELPHIA 〞 The mayor of Philadelphia says news reports about security measures that would be in place for Pope Francis visit may have deterred people from attending events over the weekend. Mayor Michael Nutter used an expletive Monday when telling reporters they scared people from attending. He later apologized for what he called his "intemperate remark" and said he expected "a timely and terse" admonishment from his mother. The pope came to Philadelphia for the Vatican-sponsored conference, the World Meeting of Families. Officials with the conference had estimated that 1.5 million would show up for the pope s visit. Nutter didn t provide any final crowd numbers Monday. Nutter also blamed a lack of communication between Philadelphia and its neighbors and information that leaked out over the summer before plans were finalized.

Enki Bracaj reads the news during a screen test for a presenting role TV chiefs in Albania were so impressed by the screen test of 21-year-old Enki Bracaj from the capital Tirana, that they gave her a job. She now reads the news to a booming audience on local TV channel Zjarr, where most of the attention from viewers is focused on her almost open top. "Most agree that her presentation style is somewhat awkward, but we are working on that and to be honest it doesn't seem to be doing any harm to her viewing figures," a spokesman for the TV channel said. The young woman, who studies public relations, presents an international news program where it is quite clear that she is not wearing a bra and her almost naked breasts can clearly be seen under her suit. Defending the decision to offer almost topless news, she said: "It is not easy to enter the world of television. "So it was obvious that if I wanted to make it I had to be brave and offer something different. "I checked first with my parents and when I found that they also supported me in my decision, it wasn't a problem for me to go ahead like this." Enki added: "There is not just a lot of competition to get on television, but also competition between the channels. "I simply found a way to put myself ahead and also to ensure that my channel gets the best ratings." Agencies

PRWeb The newest episode of VOICES IN AMERICA, hosted by James Earl Jones, will feature discussion on the business of hedge fund management. Focusing on what hedge funds are, how they affect modern society and where they are expected to move in the future, the segment will explore the ins and outs of one of the world s largest industries. With more than $2.7 trillion in assets under management, the global hedge fund industry is one of the most influential in the world. Hedge fund managers directly support economic growth with their investment choices and provide reliable income for many of the world s wealthiest individuals. But today s hedge fund industry is one in flux. Stock market volatility is at an all-time high, potentially dragging down yields and manager flexibility. At the same time, new strategies are emerging that give mom-and-pop investors the opportunity to access the previously-exclusive hedge fund space. The program will examine how the industry got to this point and the ways it can be expected to evolve going forward. "Voices In America" is an independent production that is distributed to Public Television Stations across the nation for airing at their discretion.

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is open to a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally, views such a move as a back-burner issue in his approach to immigration. Rubio said this week on Fox News [1] that Congress first must pass measures to secure the border and update the immigration system. Then, a decade later, lawmakers can turn to legal citizenship for the estimated 11 million people in the U.S. illegally, he said. It s the first time Rubio, who is vying for the G...

Raccoons are often claimed to be giants, but a trapper that has put away quite a lot of fox and raccoon says: "Lots of people say they have caught 40+ pound coons. Well I want to see a picture of this coon weighed on a accurate scale! I ve caught hundreds upon hundreds of coons and have yet to see one top 35 pounds." This is not to say that very large raccoons have not been documented. According to "Raccoons: A Natural History," by Samuel I. Zeveloff, the average weight for an adult raccoon is 8 to 20 pounds, but occasionally a very old, very well fed boar raccoon will top 30 pounds. The heaviest raccoon ever recorded was a monster Wisconsin raccoon that weighed an amazing 62 pounds and 6 ounces! Zeveloff also notes an old and quite rotund Texas raccoon that tipped the scales at 56 pounds. Another odd bit from the same book: a raccoon holding onto the inside of a tree once supported a 200-pound man hanging from its tail. Related Post: ** Measurement Informs, Exaggeration Deforms
Director of sexual health at the Cairns Sexual Health Service Dr Darren Russell said infected pregnant women could unknowingly transmit the infection to their unborn baby, causing congenital syphilis which could result in miscarriage, stillbirth or infant death. "We recognise that this is a very delicate matter and can be difficult for people. However, syphilis can be treated easily and the testing process is simple," Dr Russell said. "The sooner syphilis is detected, the more likely it is to be cured quickly." Syphilis is spread from sexual contact with a person who has the infection, and can be prevented through the proper use of condoms. Antibiotics are usually given to treat the bacterial disease. "We are urging the general public to access local health services and also calling on GPs to encourage testing in people at risk, which includes young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, gay and bisexual men," said Dr Russell.

On a holiday weekend closing out the summer of 2015, nobody expected last night's primetime to light the fires and burn the tires. Still some compelling NASCAR gave NBC a clear victory lap on Sunday with a 1.1/4 overall rating and 5.67 million viewers on a slow Sunday. Now, being that we are talking about live sports the results for the net's 7 每 11 PM coverage are tentative and will very likely change in the final numbers. Of course on the track the numbers and winners were clear and so was, it can't go without mentioning, the very retro throwback look for the Southern 500 at Darlington, SC last night. So everyone, what did you think? Did you like NASCARthrowback ?!? pic.twitter.com/XtIMKcGTw2 〞 NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) September 7, 2015 In metered market results, last night's NASCAR on NBC coverage of the Sprint Cup pulled in a 3.36 rating from 7:30 PM to midnight. That's the best Labor Day weekend overnight racing result since 2007, according to Nielsen. Otherwise, it was a very quiet night Sunday with Big Brother (1.6/7) and Bachelor In Paradise (1.0/4) the only originals on. Like previous Labor Day weekend Sundays, they took a hit. While the top rated and second most watched show of the night (5.52 million), BB was down 27% among adults 18-49 from last week. BiP fell 23% from its August 30 show.

Nationals from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan banned from entering Kuwait Image Credit: Gulf News Archive Kuwait s ban on issuing visas to nationals from five countries includes suspending all tourism, visit and trade visas as well as visas sponsored by spouses, immigration sources said. Manama: Kuwait has banned nationals from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan from entering the country, local media have reported. The ban includes suspending all tourism, visit and trade visas as well as visas sponsored by spouses, immigration sources said, quoted by Kuwaiti media on Saturday. They attributed the blanket visa ban to the "difficult security conditions in the five countries" and to "the remarkably increasing tendency of nationals from the five countries to apply for visas to bring in relatives who faced or could face arrest by the local authorities to Kuwait." The sources said the authorities insisted that no exception in the visa application would be tolerated, but added that the ban was temporarily and would be lifted after the security situation stabilised. Last month, a social affairs and labour official denied reports that Kuwait was planning to impose a ban on issuing visas to nationals from the five countries.

SWINDON Town have bolstered their attacking options with the signing of Estonian international Henrik Ojamaa, according to reports. Earlier this week, Town chairman Lee Power revealed that the 24-year-old, who can play as a striker or on the wing, was due in the country for talks and according to BBC Wiltshire the deal has now been completed. Ojamaa signs on a free transfer following his release from Polish side Legia Warsaw and has agreed a one-year deal at the County Ground , with an option for a further year. The 23-cap international becomes the third forward to sign for Town this week, following the arrival of Wes Thomas on loan from Birmingham on transfer deadline day and Nicky Ajose on a free transfer yesterday.

I wash my face at least once a day (twice if I'm feeling productive) and I prefer to do so while in the shower. Why? I find that when I wash my face by the sink, I always make a mess. Water gets splashed everywhere and my shirt gets soaking wet. My face also feels more clean when I wash it in the shower. I don't know maybe it's psychological. Anyway, when I was informed by my co-workers that you shouldn't wash your face in the shower, I was completely baffled. Dr. Elizabeth Tanzi, co-director of the Washington Institute of Dermatologic Laser Surgery in Washington D.C., told The Gloss , "I recommend that my patients wash their faces at the sink [instead]. [You can gauge the temperature more effectively] and should use lukewarm to cold water, which is better for delicate faces." Cold water also seals your pores, which doesn't allow excess dirt and oil to get trapped beneath. In addition, lukewarm or cold water won't strip your skin of its natural oils. Although it's an extra step, try washing your face by the sink and not in the hot shower and see if it makes a difference with your skin. Don't miss two reasons why you should shorten your shower time and here's how to take a proper shower ! [Photo: Shutterstock]

Mumbai, Sep 23: Enforcement Directorate (ED) is likely to interrogate Indrani Mukherjea, a prime accused in her daughter Sheena Bora Murder case to probe into the 'Money Laundering' angle involving finances in INX Media, founded by Indrani and her husband Peter. Former Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria, who was supervising investigation in murder of Sheena Bora, had written a letter to ED to investigate into the finance matter involving INX media. Mr Maria was suddenly removed from the Commissioner post and transferred to Director General of Home Guards, on promotion by the state government. It may be recalled that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) spokesperson Nawab Mallik had already demanded an ED investigation into the case. He said "If the investigation is done in detail with proper monitoring, a big name will be exposed." The Mumbai police investigating the murder case had asked Enforcement Directorate (ED) to look into and probe financial transactions of the accused in this case and into the business ventures floated by Indrani and Peter. The NCP leader alleged that Maria was shunted out as the name of an industrialist close to a top BJP leader had cropped up during the course of investigation into the case and that Maria was close to unearthing money laundering in INX Media. Indrani, her former husband Sanjiv Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai have been arrested on charges of murdering Sheena Bora and disposing off her body at Pen forest in Maharashtra's Raigad district in April 2

RAMSEY, N.J. , Sept. 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Memory Care Living is reinventing the way Alzheimer s disease and dementia care is practiced. Some symptoms of Alzheimer s disease and other types of dementia are forgetfulness, aggression, delusions and wandering. The industry standard is to administer anti-psychotic drugs to alleviate symptoms of the disease. Memory Care Living is moving away from using anti-psychotic drugs and instead uses behavioral tracking to meet the needs of residents. Memory Care Living has 13 communities throughout New Jersey . Cheryl Salo , house leader for Memory Care Living, works with residents daily. "Memory Care Living s goal is to increase the cognitive and physical activity of our residents. We learn about our residents and track actions to find the reason behind their challenging behaviors without resorting to antipsychotics," Salo said. In 2005, The FDA issued a public health advisory to alert health care providers and patients about increased mortality associated with anti-psychotic drugs used by patients with dementia. Despite the warning, a 2015 Danish psychotropic drug study suggests over 75 percent of patients with dementia are treated with anti-psychotic medications. The move away from institutionalized care is new to the senior healthcare industry. Memory Care Living is a leading provider of elder care, focusing specifically on Alzheimer s disease and dementia. The company emphasizes personalizing the care for each resident. For more information, contact Elissia Gobencion , Director of Communication at egobencion@memorycareliving.com or 201-615-5954.

The deal values the joint venture that the two companies will set up at 2.75 billion euros ($3.08 billion) and operational control will be assumed by Lanxess, the German group said in a statement on Tuesday. Saudi Aramco will buy the stake for around 1.2 billion euros in cash, adjusted for debt and payables. Lanxess Chief Executive Matthias Zachert has said the group could partner with a supplier of the petrochemical butadiene, the main raw material for synthetic rubber, to be less exposed to swings in that market. Sources have told Reuters the group also held talks with European petrochemicals group Ineos, Russia s NKNK and Sibur. The search for a strategic partner for the German group s synthetic rubber business, which is the world s largest, began more than a year ago as the company sought to combat oversupply in the industry. Lanxess shares extended gains on the news and were up 1.5 percent at 1007 GMT. (Reporting by Ludwig Burger; Editing by Harro ten Wolde and Maria Sheahan)

THE chief executive of Oxfordshire County Council was praised for her "courage" and "great leadership" yesterday as she prepares to step down later this month. Joanna Simons is to leave after more than 10 years at the local authority, after agreeing a payout worth more than 250,000 earlier this year. Councillors praised Ms Simons for her service and handling of the Bullfinch child sex abuse scandal. A serious case review exposed earlier this year how authorities 每 principally the police and Oxfordshire County Council's children's services 每 ignored warning signs and failed to understand how grooming gangs worked until 2011. It followed a joint police and county council operation, which saw seven men jailed for a minimum of 95 years for grooming, sexually abusing and prostituting six young girls in Oxford. Conservative leader Ian Hudspeth said: "Joanna led from the front and showed great leadership. Once we knew, we took action and that was key to the successful prosecution of those seven men." Share article But the handling of her departure has been criticised as "a mess", with Labour councillor John Tanner claiming that the council was now "a ship without a captain".

Reish, dean of Western Michigan University libraries, and professor of French at WMU, has again been recognized by the French Government for his "eminent service to French education and contributions to the prestige of French culture." Reish has advanced in grade in the Ordre des Palmes acad谷miques from "chevalier" (knight), to "officier" (officer), by a decree of the Prime Minister, upon proposal by the Minister of the French National Education, Higher Learning, and Research. Today, the Order of Academic Palms with its three ranks〞the highest being Commandeur--honors academics, who, through their teaching, scholarship, and leadership, promulgate the language, literature, and culture of France within the university and globally. Reish s award came after an extensive review of his credentials by the French General Consuls of Detroit and Chicago, who sought recommendations from WMU, and then examined by the French Embassy in Washington, DC. The final decision of Reish s advancement to officier was made by the Ministry of National Education in Paris. Napoleon Bonaparte first created the Academic Palms as a title for outstanding members of the Imperial University (1808). It is the oldest honorific distinction granted to civilians while the Legion of Honor established earlier recognized members of the military.

MUMBAI: Political party offices which are to be displaced because of Metro III corridor (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) corridor are likely to be shifted in Ballard Pier near the Mumbai Port Trust Head quarters building." There are 26 government offices and 8 offices belonging to the political parties near the upcoming Metro Vidhan Bhavan Station and need resettlement. The MMRCL has suggested MTNL, BSNL, MbPT and World Trade Center as alternatives to accommodate the government offices and the offices belonging to political parties. A senior official from Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) said, "Most political parties except the Shiv sena have given their consent for this site." The political parties had suggested that since the offices of the political parties are flanked by common men, it will be advisable to locate these offices near Mantralaya. The General Administration Department, which is working out a proposal has also suggested that government offices can be shifted in Back bay Reclamation area, where the many buildings, including the World Trade Centre can be accommodate them." MMRC has agreed to bear the cost of reconstruction of the party offices once the work on the corridor is complete. Around 77,000 sq. meters of space, including 17000 sq. Meters for political parties and balance for government offices, will have to be taken on lease to accomodate them.

"Mine's the white coat with the black seams. No, not that one, to the right＃" Luckily for the attendant at this cloakroom at the V&A, the 150 nearly identical coats all belong to Faye Toogood, who lends them out as a sort of access pass to her interactive installation dreamed up for this year's London Design Festival. Visitors will find the installation 〞 a sweeping semi-circular rack holding overcoats designed by Toogood in conjunction with textile experts Kvadrat 〞 in the Clore Study Area of the British Galleries. The Danish firm has manufactured Toogood's design from a clever new compressed foam material. The coats, at first glance completely uniform, have been given their own dash of individual personality by the addition of a face drawn on the back. Each garment has a map sewn into it, leading the wearer to discover 10 coat sculptures hidden around the V&A. These design pieces, each produced by a different British manufacturer, experiment further with unusual materials, and have been fashioned from all sorts including carved marble and studded rubber. Hunt the coats down at the V&A before they disappear on 27 September. @V_and_A Photography, French+Tye / Ed Reeve Installation conceptual illustrations, Faye Toogood
We've almost reached the end of our Wednesday and for some reason we've forgotten to choose our WCW for the week. After a lot of debate, shouting, and even fighting (Don't worry it wasn't physical), the ZAlebs team was able to reach an agreement as to which entertainment personality deserved to be enlisted in our WCW catalogue. Many might remember her from her Generations days, as the catty Julia Motene and wife of Khaya Motene. Like Pamela Nomvete, Xolile kept us glued onto our TV screens every week because of her bitchy attitude. We all loved to hate her and for some viewers it was difficult to separate the actual person from the character. But for the short period she was on the soapie, Xolile made Generations one interesting soapie to watch. After leaving the soapie, Xolile Tshabalala went on a TV hiatus, but she still had a strong presence in theatre, acting in plays like The Suit and The Crucible . In 2014, Xolile was appointed as the Goodwill Ambassador for the African International Film Festival and was also appointed as a guest judge for Class Acts back in 2011. Although we don't see her as much on our TV screens, it's always great to know that Xolile is still instrumental in the South African acting industry. Image Credit: Gallo Images

Bunning does not order Davis to begin signing off the on the licenses, instead he simply tells her not to try to stop 〞 "directly or indirectly" 〞 licenses from being issued. "If Defendant Davis should interfere in any way with their issuance, that will be considered a violation of this Order and appropriate sanctions will be considered," he writes. Bunning has also asked Davis deputy clerks to issue a status report every 14 days that details their compliance with the order. Bunning s order comes just hours before a huge rally was scheduled.

There is something wrong with the Democratic Party. The candidate who is providing the only real sizzle in the Democratic presidential race right now is Bernie Sanders, a 74-year-old socialist senator from Vermont who is something of a oddball. Hillary Clinton, their front-runner, a soon-to-be 68-year-old party stalwart, is stale, bogged down in scandal and can't draw a crowd. So, who is it that many in the Democratic Party are looking to as the party's "savior" in the face of the unremarkable Democratic field so far? Answer: Joe Biden, a 72-year-old, former six-term senator from Delaware and the current vice president. And this isn't the only evidence that the Democrats have a problem. There is fundamentally something wrong with their candidate pool. In the 2014 midterm elections, the Democrats' top two senatorial candidates, Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky and Michelle Nunn in Georgia, were generational retreads trying to capitalize on famous fathers from a generation ago. And the Democrats' trophy gubernatorial candidate, Charlie Crist, was a former Republican governor of Florida. Read Full Article

The US investment firm behind surf label Billabong is set to take control of rival Quicksilver. California-based Quicksilver Inc is reportedly set to file for bankruptcy and undergo a restructure to hand control to Oaktree Capital Management. Quicksilver, which has its origins in the Victorian surfing town of Torquay, suffered a 13 per cent fall in sales in 2014 and posted a loss of $US309 million. Its shares, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, have fallen 79 per cent in 2015, and are down a further 66 per cent in after hours trade due to reports of its plans to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Those plans are not expected to affect its operations in Australia or Europe. Oaktree and another US firm did a $586 million deal to rescue the Gold Coast-based Billabong International from its financial woes in 2013. Oaktree currently holds a 38 per cent stake in Billabong, and its representative on the retailer s board, Matthew Wilson, stood down on Tuesday. Billabong said he was departing due to a potential conflict in Oaktree s investment portfolio. Billabong and Quicksilver are leading retailers of surfwear and accessories, as well as skiing and skating and apparel.

WEST POINT, N.Y. 〞 An annual freshman pillow fight at the U.S. Military Academy turned bloody this year when cadets swung pillowcases packed with hard objects, injuring 30 cadets, according to a newspaper report Saturday. Two dozen cadets suffered concussions in the Aug. 20 bedding melee, though all have since returned to duty, West Point spokesman Lt. Col. Christopher Kasker told The New York Times for a story published Saturday. While photos and video of the episode have circulated online for some time, West Point officials didn't confirm what had happened until Thursday, the newspaper said. The phone rang unanswered Saturday at the academy's press office. First-year students, known as "plebes," organize the pillow fight as a way to build camaraderie after a grueling summer of training for the rigors of West Point, Kasker told the Times. The elite academy has trained generations of Army leaders and counts U.S. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower among its graduates. "West Point applauds the cadets' desire to build esprit and regrets the injuries," Kasker said, adding that the school is investigating what happened. No cadets have been punished thus far. He said upperclassmen overseeing the fight required cadets to wear helmets. However, online video showed many bare heads. Some cadets swung pillowcases believed to have been packed with their helmets, the Times said. There are no plans to end the annual pillow showdown.

ATHENS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Greece needs to move swiftly to conclude a positive review of its economic reforms by lenders in coming weeks and start discussions on debt relief, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said on Friday.

The post Constant Contact And Email Marketing appeared first on HostGator Blog . Despite the stigma that surrounds email marketing, due primarily (and justifiably) to "spammers," this channel remains a valid and profitable avenue for generating leads, sales, and generally just reaching people. Roughly 10% of HostGator customers are Non-Profit businesses, and a recent study shows that these businesses actually get the highest open rates of any industry. An "open rate" is defined, fairly self-explanatorily, as the percentage of email messages that are opened (and presumably viewed) relative to the total number of emails sent out as part of a given email campaign. In other words, people are more likely to open an email sent from a Non-Profit than they are any other type of business. However, email marketing remains one of the best performing and most-effective ways to market a business. The aforementioned study, which was created by Constant Contact , also contains valuable information regarding the optimization of email campaigns and was created via the analysis of over 100 billion customer emails. Constant Contact is an excellent tool for small businesses to execute successful email marketing campaigns. HostGator customers can learn more by visiting this link . web hosting

Words: Ellie Ward Canadians For Esm谷 line up their atmospheric and cinematic new single Make A Sound . The chill-vibe synth-pop jam is the latest of three unveiled from the Toronto trio s upcoming debut album, Sugar , which drops October 16. Make A Sound melds together an alluring mix of upbeat retro 80s synths with Martha Meredith s dreamy stand-out vocal. The song, says Meredith, relates to, "The endless need in this industry, in this generation, to show everyone how great your life is, is exhausting. I catch myself feeling regret for not thinking to capture a special moment on camera, then catch myself, 'why isn't the moment itself enough? "

Potentially dangerous alcohol and cigarettes were seized from off licences today after they were swooped on by police. Acting on local intelligence, 12 officers carried out a special licensing operation at three shops in Hertford today, accompanied by the East Herts District Council licensing team Numerous bottles of alcohol and packets of cigarettes were taken after information received from the public suggested they could be counterfeit or had not had the duty paid. The items will now be examined by Custom and Excise. Community safety sergeant for Hertford and Ware, Bianca Flatman, said: "This operation was an excellent example of partnership agencies working together after receiving information about illegal activity in the licensing trade. "We regularly carry out spot checks on our licensed premises to check they are operating within the law." Chief inspector Gerry McDonald added: "It is vital that people keep us informed about such information, as counterfeit goods can be extremely dangerous. "There is also a revenue implication, but, for me, protecting our communities is vital. "I therefore would ask that if you find such products on sale you contact us, as you can clearly see that we take community information seriously and act on it."
CANBERRA, Sept 10, 2015: The principal of a Canberra school has been sacked after news emerged that an autistic child was kept in a purpose-built cage at the school, prompting an investigation by officials. According to The Independent , authorities said the metal 2m by 2m by 2m cage with a roof, self-closing door and latch was built by an external builder in March. It added that the decision to construct the "inappropriate structure" was taken solely by the school's principal, who has now left their position and "won't be going back to a school". ABC reporter Joy Burch, Education Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, criticised the publication this week of photos of the structure, which she said would be heart-breaking for the boy's family. The pupil is believed to be a 10-year-old boy with autism, although this had not been confirmed by the authorities. The Independent reported that the cage was removed within 14 days after the Minister for Education and Training was notified of a complaint about the school made to the Commissioner for Children and Young People. "The structure was designed as a space for a student to calm down and when the student needed a quiet space," the report explained. "There was one occasion where the student was put in the structure by staff to calm down."

A view of the UniCredit bank headquaters in downtown Milan, in this February 2, 2015 file photo. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/Files MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit Chief Executive Federico Ghizzoni declined to comment on Thursday on a report that the Italian bank was mulling more than 10,000 lay-offs saying there were no specific figures yet on the table. "I do not comment because we are going to present our plan in November or in any case by the end of the year. We are working on it, it s not the moment to talk, we still don t have concrete numbers ourselves," he said on the sidelines of an event. Bloomberg reported earlier on Thursday the Italian bank, the country s biggest by assets, was considering cutting at least 10,000 jobs as it reviews its strategic plan. UniCredit, which employs 146,600 people and operates in 17 countries, has already announced 2,700 job cuts by 2018 that still need to be implemented. The lender is reworking a five-year strategic plan, unveiled less than 18 months ago, to boost revenues and cut costs. Two union sources said the group had not discussed additional job cuts with unions. The bank is under pressure to bolster its financial strength and cut costs - particularly in Germany and Austria - to allay once and for all market concerns that it may need to launch a capital increase, something Ghizzoni has repeatedly denied.

By By | The Malay Mail Online 每 PUTRAJAYA, Sept 2 求 Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak was advised against showing up at an international anti-corruption conference here due to "security" concerns and the expected "hostile" environment he would face, minister Datuk Paul Low said today. Low said up to yesterday, Najib was still expected to show up at the 16th International Anti-Corruption Conference. Low explained that Najib was initially slated to appear as a head of government where certain levels of protocol are expected, but said that he had expected a "hostile" reception to Najib in view of the circumstances and issues involving the latter personally. "As a minister, I have to advise him because I know the conditions of the meeting. "I said, whatever it is, I m going in, if you want to go in, by all means, because of this, we advised him in terms of security, in terms of atmosphere, it s better I take his slot," the minister in charge of governance, integrity and human rights said today during a question and answer session here. Instead of Najib, Low will be delivering the keynote speech later this afternoon at the opening ceremony of this three-day conference. Many of the questions directed against Low this morning revolved around investigations on state-owned firm 1MDB and the allegations against Najib. MORE TO COME

Dear Editor, Richard Glossip is scheduled to be executed Sept. 16, 2015 as I'm sure many of you are aware. I do not know Richard and I am from Texas. But I have been keeping up with Richards case. It caught my eye one day when I read the actual killer of Barry Van Treese was serving a life sentence in a medium security prison. It appears Justin Sneed ( the actual killer) was coerced by the police to say what they wanted to hear. In return Justin Sneed the actual killer gets life while an innocent man goes to death row. I have read everything I can find about this case and I believe Mr. Richard Glossip is innocent. Oklahoma law says if you hire someone to kill another you get the death penalty. With this law in place what is there to keep injustices such as Richard Glossips from happening again when the real killer knows if he kills and robs then names another that hired him to kill he can avoid the death penalty. People from Oklahoma, and I love Oklahoma 〞 my dad was born and raised there 〞 but please go to Richard Glossips site and read for yourself. Oklahoma is about to kill an innocent man. There have already been innocent people executed. We don't need another. Bobby Wall Abilene, Texas

Bill Cosby has at least one person in his camp: fellow comedian Damon Wayans . While doing a radio interview for Power 105.1 on Friday, Wayans went on a bitter, misogynistic rant about the dozens of women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault. "I don t believe that he was raping," Wayans, 55, said. "I believe he was in relationships with all of them, and then he s like, You know what? It s 78. It don t work like that no more. I can t get it up for any of y all. Bye, bitches, and then they re like, Oh, really? Rape! " Why no one should be surprised by the accusations against Bill Cosby "How big is his penis that it gives you amnesia for 40 years?" he added. Wayans went on to call the lawsuits that have been filed against Cosby "a money hoax" and spoke about Cosby s accusers in disgustingly offensive terms. "Just listen to what they re saying and some of them really [are] un-rape-able," Wayans said. "I just look at them and go, You don t want that. Get out of here. " He also noted that other stars who have been accused of sexual abuse, including Woody Allen and 7th Heaven s Stephen Collins , have not received the same volume of criticism that Cosby has.

Sailer: General Franco used Moroccans to shatter the morale of the Spanish Left in the early days of the Spanish Civil War. And the Allies used French-commanded Moroccans to finally dislodge the Germans from strategic Monte Cassino in Italy. The French Allied general promised his Muslim troops that if they succeeded in driving the Germans off of the mountain, they would get 50 hours to rape Italian civilian women with impunity. ( Sophia Loren won her Oscar for a movie about this , but since then it appears to have disappeared down the memory hole outside of Italy.) Personally, I think Europeans should try harder to get along with each other rather than import Muslims to spread terror and rape in Europe for partisan advantage in intra-European squabbles. But then I'm some kind of wacko extremist, so I would say that, wouldn't I? Kathy Shaidle s NEW book, Confessions of a Failed Slut , is available HERE .

O verall it s the clarity of design that impresses most, though, with the screen so much better integrated than in cars from the German premium marques. And Vauxhall has also eschewed the tendency to load up the steering wheel with too many functions. There s good storage space, a proper manual handbrake lever in all-but the range-topping Elite model, and enough leg and head room to accommodate two large adults in the rear. However, the boot isn't massive and the load lip is quite high, even if there s a tough-looking liner. I wasn t convinced by the seats, either, which feel hard and slightly uncomfortable. And there are a few signs of cost cutting, particularly the steering-wheel adjustment lever, which feels like a bit of discarded packaging. Light-emitting diode headlamps are available (the Peugeot 308 is the only other car in the class to have them) and Vauxhall, keen to show them off, gave us a car with conventional lamps for the night drive... The idea with the LED lanterns is that they bring more precision and brightness and that they automatically dip for oncoming traffic, which I understand from colleagues they did more than adequately. Dynamically, taking 130kg out of any car is likely to improve ride comfort and agility and so it proves. The new Astra absorbs bumps and undulations with more aplomb and it turns into corners quicker. In fact, in any situation where it is being asked to respond to accelerator, steering, braking or road-surface changes, it s faster, more progressive and succinct.

Floyd Mayweather "officially" retired (again) after defeating Andre Berto on Saturday night. Floyd Mayweather completely shut out Andre Berto during their September 12 fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. While PPV and ticket sales won t be comparable to the last few Mayweather bouts throughout the years, the fight played out exactly as you would expect. Mayweather controlled the fight and comfortably won with judges scoring it at 117-111, 118-110, and 120-108. Shortly after the contest, Floyd took the mic to announce yet another retirement from the sport of boxing. "My career is over. It s official," Mayweather said after the victory. "I ve accomplished everything. There s nothing left to accomplish in this sport. I don t want to rank myself, but I m the best at boxing." If Floyd really calls it quits, he will end his career with a 49-0 record with 26 knockouts. There aren t many who believe him though, as he has already said the exact same things multiple times since 2007.

COVINGTON, TN (WMC) - The Covington Police Department is the latest Mid-South Police Department to roll out the use of body cameras. A grant helped the department buy 27 cameras for around $26,000. "It s accountability for our officers; it s public safety for our citizens," said Covington Mayor Justin Hanson. Officers are required to record every call they are sent out on. The cameras record video, audio, and snapshots. The camera system also does not allow an officer to delete any of the recorded footage. "This day and time, I think it s so important for transparency," said Chief Buddy Lewis. The camera footage is stored for 90 days before it is deleted.

Investigators say three men seen in a video from a home near where a northern Illinois police officer was fatally shot were not involved in the slaying. Tuesday s announcement by the leader of the task force investigating last week s killing of Fox Lake Police Lieutenant Charles Joseph Gliniewicz puts to rest what authorities said was a promising lead into the identities of the suspects. Lake County Major Crime Task Force George Filenko says investigators questioned the three men in the video and are confident they were not involved in the slaying. Filenko said investigators are working to identify DNA from an "unknown donor" found at the scene. Gliniewicz was found shot to death Sept. 1 in a remote area shortly after he radioed that he was pursuing three suspicious men.
JONESBORO, AR (KAIT) - Students from Nettleton High School held the first Touch a Truck event for kids in the Region 8 area. The event offered kids the opportunity to touch and get behind the wheel of many different vehicles they may see every day. Police cars, ambulances and mail trucks were only a few of the options available. Jordan Lee, a senior at Nettleton High School, explained he and a group of students coordinated the event from the ground up. Planning began in April of this year and included networking with various groups in Jonesboro. Lee said he was excited to see so many people come out and show their support even with the threat of rain. "I think sometimes we kinda take it for granted that we live in Jonesboro," Lee said. "Jonesboro is a great community and they are always very supportive of things like this. Even in the midst of the fair going on and the barbeque fest, everybody still wants to put their best foot forward and at least come out and support 1 way or another. So that feels really great." He was happy to see the work and stress well received by everyone who attended Saturday. Copyright 2015 KAIT. All rights reserved. Region 8 News App - Install o
England captain Wayne Rooney became the joint-top goalscorer in the national team s history on Saturday, equalling Bobby Charlton s record after netting the 49th goal of his international career against San Marino. Sky Sports Football confirmed Rooney s record-equalling strike, marking the end of Charlton s 47-year run as England s top scorer, having taken the accolade from Jimmy Greaves in 1968. Remarkably, Rooney s landmark effort was scored almost exactly 12 years after he netted his first international goal against Macedonia. Manchester United captain Rooney is also moving higher in England s all-time appearance charts, earning his 106th cap on Saturday to move further within reach of Peter Shilton s haul of 125. In the buildup to the Three Lions Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania in March, club team-mate Michael Carrick predicted it was merely "a matter of time" until Rooney claimed the award, per the Daily Telegraph s Henry Winter: Manager Roy Hodgson s armband wearer has been forced to adapt his role within England s ranks on numerous occasions over the years, but he has always maintained his place as one of the team s deadliest finishers. This historic achievement serves as recognition of Rooney s ongoing importance to the Three Lions as they look to seal their place at Euro 2016.

A FORMER close friend of controversial Sunshine Coast MP Clive Palmer will begin legal action today, claiming almost $5 million in damages resulting from a sham contract . Bill Schoch is suing former boss Clive Palmer for $4,682,812 and seeking to have his "sham" contract set aside. The trial, which is expected to take two weeks, will begin in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday. Court documents show Mr Palmer and two companies - Mineralogy Pty Ltd and Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd - are listed as defendants in the case. But it is unclear whether Mr Palmer will give evidence. Mr Schoch and his wife are expected to give evidence for the plaintiff s case. Mr Schoch, who ran Palmer Coolum Resort until his contract was terminated, argued the contract was void because of Mr Palmer s allegedly "misleading and deceptive conduct". In documents lodged in the Brisbane Supreme Court, Mr Schoch said his employment contract was reduced from $1million a year - contingent on completing particular tasks - to $150,000 a year fixed. He said a five-year fixed term disappeared, giving him "no security of employment at all". Mr Palmer shut the resort down, costing hundreds of workers jobs. He claimed it was being being closed for an upgrade but locals say there has been little evidence of that.

Scott Allen On Wednesday, WISN'S Mark Belling talked again about the proposed city loan to Sunset Homes , a rundown condo development in financial trouble, focusing on the support from State Rep Scott Allen. Belling says the issue is a real embarrassment to Allen, and calls the loan, "close to socialism." "All I can assume is that Scott Allen is a total phony." The commentary starts right after the weather. I think Belling was going a little over the top when he suggested the District Attorney might have to be called in. After all, it's not like Allen voted on the issue. Print this entry

NBC News - The Justice Department has reached a settlement with General Motors over the issue of faulty ignition switches that led to over 100 deaths and hundreds of injuries, according to officials familiar with the case. The Justice Department will announce the settlement Thursday at a news conference in New York. It will include a fine of hundreds of millions of dollars, the officials say. The agreement will settle charges that the company failed to obey federal laws that require prompt disclosure of safety problems. Last year, GM began recalling two-and-a-half-million cars with ignition switches that could suddenly shut off the engine 〞 disabling the airbags and cutting off the power steering and power brakes. Prosecutors say the company knew about the problem for more than a decade before reporting it. GM has determined that the switches led to accidents resulting in 124 deaths and 273 injuries. Victims and families have accepted compensation from GM of at least $1 million each. Officials familiar with the settlement say GM will pay the government a fine of more than half a billion dollars 〞 getting some credit for cooperating with the federal investigation. Separately, victims and their families have accepted compensation from GM of at least $1 million each.

The cold front has dragged down a much cooler air mass for the remainder of the week. Highs will struggle to hang onto the 60∼ mark through Woollybear Sunday. You'll certainly need your sweaters, jeans, and potentially some rain gear as well. The cool weather pattern persists through next week. Hurricane Joaquin will interact with a weather system over the southeastern US, keeping things unsettled through the weekend. Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center says that Joaquin could become a major hurricane on Saturday! Watch for the latest updates since the storm could be a real issue for east coast travel and may impact northeastern Ohio weather as well. One computer model is rather aggressive in keeping the rainy pattern in place into Monday:

A day after his arrest early Thursday in Midland for driving under the influence of alcohol, ex-NFL player Stuart Schweigert told the Daily News this afternoon that he appreciated the opportunity to serve as a volunteer assistant coach with the Saginaw Valley State University football program. An SVSU spokesman confirmed today that Schweigert is no longer with the program. "I really enjoyed my time with Coach Collins, his staff, and the players I worked with," Schweigert told an MDN reporter today. "I hope in the future I will have the opportunity to continue where I left off with the Cardinals. "I have challenges in front of me that I plan to meet head-on," Schweigert added. Schweigert, 34, was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol after a traffic stop on South Saginaw Road, near Bay City Road, at 2:30 a.m. on Thursday, according to a story on MLive. Schweigert, a Saginaw Heritage graduate who played 53 games with four teams in the NFL, including the Detroit Lions, joined the Cardinals' coaching staff as a volunteer in August. Schweigert is scheduled for arraignment at 9 a.m. Wednesday, Oct. 7 before Midland County District Court Judge Michael Carpenter.
Comments (0) A couple from Little Hallingbury are hoping readers of the Observer can help them unravel a mystery. Sheila and Paul Hammond discovered an old picture which had been hidden behind a photo in the same frame for decades. They are keen to trace the descendents of the five members of the family who are featured in the profile silhouette: James Gifford Nash (1812-1877), Elizabeth Nash (1806-1879, who was married to Edmund Vipan Ind of Romford), Frederick John Nash (1774-1851), all of Bishop s Stortford, Frederick Woodham Nash (1808-1876) of Sion House, Birchanger, and William Nash (Woodham) (1800-1876) of Shepreth, Cambs. The Nash family had links with brewer Ind Coope. The picture was behind a photo of Sheila s late grandfather, Alfred Burrows, of Little Hallingbury. "It s been in my loft probably since my grandfather died 40-plus years ago," said Sheila, 65, of Motts Green. "It was such a surprise when I found it. To think that it had been there all those years and I didn t know anything about it."

When it comes to the idea that running is good for the heart, six miles a week may be the magic goal number. In a review study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, experts found running about six miles a week 〞 or 52 minutes 〞 may add from three to six years to your life. Dr. Edward Laskowski, co-director of the Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center, says the study supports the existing body of scientific literature that shows exercise is good for your health. "The great news is that you don t have to run a marathon to benefit from exercise," he says. "Just getting out there and moving more helps. Exercise benefits many things, including your cardiovascular system, and it cuts the risk of some cancers." Laskowski adds that even simple activities such as taking a few five-minute walk breaks at work, or walking while talking on the phone, are effective ways to build activity into your life. The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans are
Novak Djokovic tipped his hat to Serena and Venus Williams ahead of their 27th career meeting but admitted Sunday he would find it impossible to play his own brother. The world No.1 has two tennis-playing younger brothers - 24-year-old Marko and Djorde, who s 20. Both play on the sport s lower-level tours, which suits Djokovic just fine. That s a luxury which neither Serena nor Venus can afford and they clash again on Tuesday for a place in the US Open semi-finals with Serena chasing a calendar Grand Slam. "The first thing that comes to my mind is how would I feel to play my brother, and I don t think that would be possible, honestly," said Djokovic after reaching his 26th Grand Slam quarter-final Sunday in New York. "In a way I admire what they re doing for so many years to play against each other on such a big stage. It s strange. They are sisters. They live together. They grew up together playing tennis. "But I don t know if I ll be able to play my brother. It s not possible. I would not be able to handle it on the court."
jQuery-UI Eating Contest Using a jQuery-UI modal dialog in your Meteor app is as easy as the proverbial pie (eating it, that is, not making it, which is decidedly more difficult); simply follow these steps: 0) In the console, enter "meteor add linto:jquery-ui" to install the package 1) Add a "hide" CSS class: .hide 2) Add some HTML to the Template where the Dialog should display, hiding it by default, such as: <template name="platypus"> <div id="duckbill" name="duckbill"> <h2>Duckbilled Platypi of the World Unite!</h2> <img alt="platypus image" height="275" id="imgPlatypusParty" name="imgPlatypusParty" src="images/dplat.png" width="350" /></div> <div class="hide" id="dialog" title="Basic dialog"> <p>Put whatever you want in here.</p> </div> </template> 3) In response to some event, unhide the div and call dialog() on it, such as: Template.platypus.events(); And that s all there is to it! It s almost as easy as falling off a log, and is as easy as pie, which is "funner."
So many swimming adventures this year-- Greenwood, state parks, my uncle s pond. I only took my camera up to the pond once, so you can thank that camera for these snapshots, and we ll thank my aunt and uncle for such a charmed place to swim. Mildred is a cautious one and would make my Dad proud, but this was her last jump of the summer with a life jacket. She discarded it soon after and never looked back, the daredevil. Bathing suit malfunction. Ezekiel, for shame!
China s virtual carriers have only developed 11.23 million users of mobile telecom resale business, in which 20-30 percent are active users, the National Business Daily quoted an expert as saying on Monday. Zou Xueyong, secretary-general of China s virtual carrier industry alliance, said the 42 virtual carriers are still running in the red, despite their attempt on exploring new business models and continuous investment. He said there are seven or eight virtual carriers have invested more than 100 million yuan in the mobile telecom resale business. Zou forecasts that a Chinese virtual carrier will reach balance of payments only after it increases the average revenue per user (ARPU) to 35 yuan and obtains more than one million users.

This is in regard to an article by Kathryn Edin and H. Luke Shaefer, "The poor need food to eat but cash to live" (The Sun, Sept. 11). There are so many safety-net and welfare programs that it seems a shame this family must have fallen through the cracks. The first example given, of 19-year-old Ashley with her baby, illustrates this. One of the first programs Ashley should have taken advantage of was the free birth control. There was no reason for another fatherless child to be brought into her situation. Food stamp beneficiaries are at an all-time high, exceeding 45 million for 50 months straight. More than 90 percent of Middle Eastern refugees are on food stamps, and 70 percent receive cash assistance. Should this not be spent on Ashley and other American families who need training to learn how to be independent? Instead of Ms. Edin looking to taxpayers to pay more, she should look at why we are giving so much to others that should be kept for the poor citizens of this country.

The short-term and long-term copper and molybdenum price estimates have been lowered primarily due to industrial production slowing and cost curves falling, driven by the depreciation in the currencies of the emerging markets and the declining energy costs. However, Mazzaferro believes that Freeport-McMoRan would be able to generate EBITDA of $8.0 billion and $8.4 billion in 2016 and 2017, respectively. "Freeport should be able to capture further gains by curtailing its unprofitable molybdenum production and optimizing uncompetitive copper operations," Mazzaferro added. The company has announced during the week ending September 18 that it had been able to raise $1 billion through the sales of 96.7 million shares "through an at-the-market stock issuance," and that the company might consider raising another $1 billion if additional liquidity is required in future. According to the Macquarie report, "The company still has the opportunity to sell, divest or find partners for some of its expansion projects and non-core assets that would also strengthen its balance sheet and improve liquidity." In addition, the company's board is likely to approve a $0.05 per share cut in the dividend, which would help Freeport-McMoRan to save an additional $225 million per year. The EPS estimates for 2015, 2016 and 2017 have, however, been reduced.

The latest addition to my collection 6mm airfield buildings is a pair of corrugated Nissan huts from Leven Miniatures. These are typical of the sort seen at RAF sites across the country and indeed across the Empire (as it was then). With territory - and therefore airstrips - in North Africa switching hands several times during the campaign its not unreasonable to expect buildings like this to be employed by whichever side happens to control the territory at the time, so these could be used for Allied or Axis airfields. The Nissen hut was actually a WWI design for a modular and easily portable building that could be erected or dismantled quickly (6 men could build one in just four hours). One hundred thousand were built in the first world war but the design was again adopted for military use during WWII. Leaky and drafty in winter and stifling hot in summer these were not comfortable buildings but they did serve a vital role and many were converted to civilian use after the war.

Sept. 18 (BusinessDesk) - Former OPI Pacific Finance Director Craig White has pleaded guilty to misleading investors, the same day two of his fellow board members were sentenced to community service for earlier pleas. White pleaded guilty to two charges under the Securities Act including distributing an advertisement and signing off on an prospectus in 2007, which included untrue statements, market watchdog the Financial Markets Authority said in a statement. He will be sentenced in the High Court in Auckland on Sept. 23. "The guilty plea shows that Mr White has accepted responsibility for his failure to fulfil his disclosure obligations to investors," said Paul O'Neil, FMA acting director of enforcement and investigations. White s guilty plea comes the same day former OPI directors Mark Lacy and Jason Maywald were sentenced to 200 hours of community work and ordered to pay A$100,000 in reparations for their guilty pleas. Former director David Anderson is scheduled to stand trial on Oct. 5. OPI provided finance to commercial property developers and investors and was tipped into receivership in September 2009 and then liquidation two years later. More than 10,000 investors were owed about $247 million. As at July this year, investors had been repaid 30.23 cents in the dollar.

Television show "Kuch Toh Hai Tere Mere Darmiyaan" will make its way onto the small screen on September 28 through Star Plus channel in a prime-time slot instead of night-time slot. The show, which was earlier rumoured to replace the repeat slot of "Ye Hai Mohabbatein" at 11 p.m., is taking the place of "Phir Bhi Na Maane..Badtameez Dil" at 8.30 p.m. According to a source, the night time slot of "Ye Hai Mohabbatein" was getting good TRPs and since the makers of that show was Balaji Telefilms again the decision was to replace it with the next Balaji show. "Karan Patel and Divyanka Tripathi, the lead pair of Ye Hai Mohabbatein , had shot the first promo as well introducing a new love story on behalf of Star Plus and Balaji. But the time slot changed," said the source. The first promo of the show, which has actors Shritama Mukherjee, Vibhav Roy and Gautam Gupta as the lead cast, will be aired on September 12. The show, based in Jamshedpur, is about three friends who come from different cultural backgrounds. With Tata Steel Plants as the backdrop, the plot revolves around a love triangle.

Did you know the NRA Competition Database lists nearly 7,000 national shooting records ? Why are there 7000 records? Start with the fact that there are a host of different NRA disciplines: Air Pistol, Action Pistol, High Power Rifle, Smallbore Rifle, Fullbore, just to name a few. Within each discipline there may be records for metallic sight, any sight, rapid fire, slow fire, prone, standing, and other variations. And then there may be separate records for indoor, outdoor, distance, and number of shots fired. Then add team records on top of the individual records. Finally, there are separate records for all the NRA classifications: Open, Civilian, Service, Woman, Junior, Senior, Police, and so on＃. The task of validating and registering so many different records is daunting. And the work never stops. Consider this 〞 the NRA sanctions 11,000 tournaments each year. This means that new record claims are being submitted throughout the year. Report based on story by Kyle Jillson in NRAblog.com .
Dutch architects Arno Geesink and Rick Tegelaar developed a flat-pack wind-powered Watertower for Roofgarden Arnhem . Inspired by the famous Shukhov tower, the lightweight 7.5-meter-tall, 1,000-liter-capacity structure can be assembled by hand and has sufficient pressure to power a sprinkler. Wind power produced by the tower's windmill pumps the filtered rainwater up into the holding well, where it builds up pressure. Surplus energy is supplied back to the grid. The versatile Watertower was recently used to fill up wood-fired hot tubs at the Dutch music festival Into the Great Wide Open . + Rick Tegelaar The article above was submitted to us by an Inhabitat reader.

BEREA, OH (WOIO) - A man wearing a "scream" mask robbed the U.S. Bank on Front Street in Berea Monday. FBI officials say the man also wore an Everlast sweatshirt and had most of his finger tips taped. Authorities say he approached two bank teller stations and made verbal demands for large bills. The tellers handed over the money and the masked man left. A witness in the parking lot reported seeing the man take off the mask, and that the suspect was bald. If you have any information that could help track him down, contact Berea Police or the FBI.
This week we celebrated that the Choose Life Group has been running for 3 years. We were delighted to welcome back a founder member for the celebration and people enjoyed reconnecting or meeting for the first time. Although life s struggles don t seem to take a day off we were able to have fun together with some lighthearted games allowing some hilarity, particularly at our own attempt at Would I lie to you? .....I mean, did he really spend a night in cells for a Poll Tax protest? One member reflected on how good it was that everyone could laugh together, because there have been times when one person cried and in true empathy, so did everyone else. So it s good to share life s journey, together with it s ups and downs, because supportive relationships will always make it easier. We also celebrated with people this week who had really pushed through some barriers, as discussed last week, and had found the power to do the hardest, but the best thing.

National Security Act of 1947 allows for the strategic relocation of industries, services, government and other essential economic activities, and to rationalize the requirements for manpower, resources and production facilities. 1950 Defense Production Act gives the President sweeping powers over all aspects of the economy. Act of August 29, 1916 authorizes the Secretary of the Army, in time of war, to take possession of any transportation system for transporting troops, material, or any other purpose related to the emergency. International Emergency Economic Powers Act enables the President to seize the property of a foreign country or national. These powers were transferred to FEMA in a sweeping consolidation in 1979.

Faster consoles in XO http://xen-orchestra.com/blog/faster-consoles-in-xo/ Our previous console connection was done by using a component in XenServer, named wsproxy. It was very simple to use, opposing to make a RAW HTTP connection. But the main drawbacks were:slow to connect (~2 seconds to display the console)not supported by Citrixprone to bugs when called often in a limited time (a lot of wsproxy processes still actives on the XenServer host). So we had to connect in RAW HTTP, and it works now! The result? Faster (almost instant) console display.

Very few vehicles in the world look good in black, but the 2005 Maserati MC12 is a supercar that looks incredible in any color. It just so happens that black fits the MC12 extremely well and is the vehicle's rarest color. Of the 50 MC12s produced, there's only one that was finished in Metallic Black and it just sold for $1.57 million at Mecum Auctions. All of the other MC12s were finished in pearl white with bright blue accents, which makes this all black beauty extremely rare. Unbelievably, other MC12s are going for much more.

The man had anaesthetic medicine & surgical equipment as well as female body parts in his home. JOHANNESBURG - A Danish man has appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on charges of sexual assault and contravening the Medicines Act, after 21 parts of female genitalia were found in his freezer. Fifty-eight-year-old, Pieter Fredekrisen was arrested last week after police searched his house in Langenhoven Park. Police have confiscated anaesthetic medicine and surgical equipment as well as the body parts which were bagged in the freezer. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says the suspect allegedly sedated his victims before performing the illegal surgeries. "We did find that these are female human specimens, that we managed to pick up. We are now working with our forensics to ascertain as to how many women were affected by this man." He says Fredekrisen has a history of crime and is apparently wanted for dealing in illegal firearms in Denmark. "It's still an on-going investigation. We have reason to believe the information which still has to be confirmed in writing." Police are calling for his victims to come forward ahead of his bail application next week.

Radamel Falcao has issued Chelsea with a rallying cry ahead of their clash against Everton on Saturday. The west London side make the trip to Goodison Park as Jose Mourinho's side look to record their second Premier League victory of the season. The defending Premier League champions have taken just four points from their opening four top-flight games. Falcao scored his first goal for Chelsea in their 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace in their last Premier League fixture before the international break. And the Colombia international took to Instagram to post a motivational message ahead of their Goodison Park clash. Falcao wrote: "Premier is back, ready for today's match." Falcao endured a disappointing loan spell at United last season, only managing to score four goals for the Red Devils during his temporary move to Old Trafford.

Fremont senior all-state guard Rylie Cascio Jensen has made an oral commitment to play women's basketball at South Dakota beginning in the 2016-17 season. The 5-foot-10 Cascio Jensen earned second-team Super-State and second-team Class A all-state honors last season when she averaged 19 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. She chose South Dakota over Wyoming, Wake Forest and Drake. "They treated me like family on my official visit and that sold me on the school," said Cascio Jensen, who will be a pre-med major with the ultimate goal of becoming an orthodontist. "I really enjoyed the coaches and players, and I felt like I fit in there," added Cascio Jensen, who was hosted by former Bellevue West all-stater Kate Liveringhouse on her official visit. South Dakota will be playing in a new 6,000-seat arena next year, "and it looks like that's going to be awesome," Cascio Jensen said. "That definitely pulled me a little more toward South Dakota." South Dakota landed first-team Super-State guard Jaycee Bradley of Norfolk and second-team Super-State guard Allison Arens of Crofton in last year's recruiting class. Both are freshmen this season.
Former Grayson College baseball player Mike Nolan is in a New York hospital after being shot in the head Friday night in the parking lot of a Burger King in Yonkers, New York. Sports Illustrated said NBC reported that Nolan, 23, was shot in the head and the upper body while he was standing outside his car with other people. The report said the shooter drove up and opened fire. The shooter still had not been caught. Yonkers police told news reporters that Nolan is believed to have been an innocent bystander and that he and the shooter may have known each other and might have had a dispute recently. Grayson College President Jeremy McMillen said Nolan was part of Grayson's baseball teams in 2012 and 2013. McMillen said those years were not national title teams for Grayson, but both of those teams won the regular season conference championships. "We are saddened at the news, and wish him and the family the best that can come out of this tragedy," McMillen said on Tuesday. "His coaches, his dorm family, and our entire campus community are pulling for him during this difficult time." Nolan was selected by the Oakland A's in the 18th round of the 2014 draft, SI said.

THESSALONIKI 〞 Farmers protesting tax hikes under Greece's international bailout agreement used tractors to disrupt traffic on a key border crossing with Turkey. Greek police say about 100 tractors were parked across a highway near the Kipi crossing since just after midday Sept. 16. Protesters prevented all trucks from leaving or approaching the Greek side of the border, but were allowing cars and buses to pass. Protesting farmers also briefly closed a highway near the northern town of Serres, and plan new protests Thursday. Farmers' unions are angry at Greece's commitments to double their income tax from 13 to 26 percent from next year, and scrap tax rebates. The planned measures are part of the country's obligations under its third international bailout deal, signed last month. The post appeared first on The National Herald .

Steve Sailer points out some inconvenient truth. Europe's self-inflicted "migrant crisis" ought to serve as a warning to Americans citizens that there's no time like the present for planning ahead to stymie similar mass assaults on America's borders. ＃ The influx of 2015 was more or less predicted by Jean Raspail in his 1973 novel, The Camp of the Saints , but few in authority in Europe appear to have ever devoted any attention to the Continent's obvious vulnerability to foreign flash mobs taking advantage of the good nature of contemporary Europeans. In contrast, the Australian government has laboriously worked out an effective system to block boat people, which has succeeded in discouraging most from even attempting the voyage. And the government of Israel has so impressively anticipated the threat of Muslim and African population surges that it only briefly suffered from sub-Saharans pouring into Israel when Egypt's Mubarak government, which had long blocked economic border-crossers as a favor to Israel, was overthrown. It's time for Americans to start thinking like Israelis rather than like Germans when it comes to defending their country.

The NFL has suspended San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Jerome Simpson for six games. The punishment stems back to a 2014 DUI incident where the Simpson was sited for driving with an open container and possession of marijuana. Simpson pleaded guilty to third-degree DUI and reckless driving. After Simpson was charged with the offenses, the Minnesota Vikings cut him. The 49ers signed the receiver during the offseason for a two-year $1.73 million deal. Simpson was in line to have been the team's No. 3 receiver behind Anquan Boldin and Torrey Smith. While Simpson sits out the six games, the position will have to be filled by either Quinton Patton, Bruce Ellington or DeAndrew White. The 49ers general manager Trent Baalke released this statement: "The probability of a suspension was known when we signed Jerome. Since joining the 49ers, Jerome has proven to be a great teammate. Although he will not be able to participate in the first six weeks of the season, Jerome has done everythi...

Chris Brown has been granted joint custody of his daughter Royalty. The 26-year-old singer had been embroiled in a bitter court battle with Nia Guzman over their 15-month-old child and according to ABC 13 News, a Houston judge has now ruled that the pair will share custody of the tot. He will continue to pay $2,500 a month child support, with the judge denying Nia s request to increase the payments to $15,000. Despite incidents - including an armed robbery at his Los Angeles home in July, when he was out of the city - Chris has insisted he is a good father and fought Nia s efforts to restrict custody of his daughter to just supervised visits. Nia previously requested full custody, claiming Chris parenting and lifestyle aren t conducive to raising a child. According to previous reports, Chris lawyers were set to argue that he never puts his daughter in harm s way and following the break-in at his home, he s also increased security. He was further believed to be planning to argue that he has never used drugs around his daughter and nor has he allowed so-called gangbangers to spend time with his child.

New Delhi, Sept. 20 - The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday alleged that the Congress Party is responsible for the pitiable condition of the farmers in the country and said that it was insulting the farming community with its move to organise a Kisan Mazdoor Samman Rally . BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra dubbed the grand old party as land grabbers . "Rahul Gandhi today speaks about the farmers and Land Acquisition. We should remind him of the fact that those who are land grabbers of farmers should not speak about Land Acquisition," Patra told ANI. "Today Rahul Gandhi and the Congress is talking of a Kisan Samman Rally . Did the Congress Party think of the farmers and the agriculturalists all these 65 years in rule? Had the Congress Party given an iota of thought towards the welfare of the farmers of India, then the conditions of the farmers of this country would not have been this pitiable," he added. Patra further said the Congress vice-president grabbed 65 acres of poor farmers land in his parliamentary constituency Amethi. The Congress Party will organize a Kisan Mazdoor Samman Rally today at the Ramlila Ground to honour farmers and party workers for forcing the NDA Government to withdraw its land ordinance.

Dublin (AFP) - Veteran Samoan lock Kane Thompson will miss his country s opening game of the upcoming rugby union World Cup against the United States after receiving a two-match ban for punching an opponent, the governing body World Rugby announced on Wednesday. The 33-year-old New Zealand-born second row, set to appear in his third World Cup, will also be unavailable for their final warm-up match against English club side Wasps on Saturday but his experience will be sorely missed against the Americans on September 20. "Kane Thompson has been suspended for two weeks (two matches) after being ordered off by referee John Lacey for striking an opponent, Saia Faingaa, in Samoa s match against the Barbarians at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London, on 29 August," read the World Rugby statement. "Having conducted a detailed review of all the evidence available, including all broadcast angles, testimony from the player and the referee in addition to submissions from Thompson s counsel, Richard Berry, the judicial officer deemed the foul play to be low-end (which has an entry point of two weeks). "The judicial officer determined that there were no aggravating factors. As regards mitigating factors, he determined that the player was not entitled to a reduction for mitigation due to a similar previous striking incident in December 2014 which led to a one-week suspension." Thompson, who plays in the English Premiership for Newcastle Falcons, will be available for selection for the Pacific Islander s second pool game against two-time world champions South Africa on September 26 in Birmingham.

Lofa County District 2 Representative Fofi Sahr Baimba has said that contrary to perceptions by many Liberians, it is not the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) to make farms in the country. He said the functions of the ministry include the governance, management and promotion of agriculture with oversight of agronomy, animal husbandry and other agricultural industries, the economic organization of the agriculture and food industries, as well as national food security. Baimba , who is the Chairman of the House Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, made the statement recently at the Ministry of Agriculture during the presentation of 12 vehicles to the Smallholder Agricultural Productivity Enhancement and Commercialization (SAPEC) project. He said it was necessary for him to make the clarification because some people in the society were holding the notion that Liberia was facing the shortage of food because the ministry was not making farms to feed the nation. The Lofa county lawmaker then admonished authorities at the ministry to get the media involved in their activities to help educate the public.
LAS VEGAS (AP) 〞 Las Vegas water officials have approved a $45 million "water banking" deal to send enough water for about 300,000 homes annually from Lake Mead to drought-parched Southern California. Southern Nevada Water Authority board members on Thursday approved selling 150,000 acre-feet of water to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The Metropolitan district board votes on the deal Monday and Tuesday. An acre-foot serves about two homes for a year. Metropolitan chief Jeffrey Kightlinger says the agreement lets his 19 million Southern California customers buy the water during drought and return it, bucket for bucket, when Las Vegas needs it back. His counterpart in Las Vegas, John Entsminger, says Las Vegas can spare the water because use has been cut by almost one-third since 2002. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

By By Tim Hanlon | Reuters 每 By Tim Hanlon BARCELONA (Reuters) 每 Lionel Messi scored one penalty and missed another as his double helped Barcelona sweep Levante aside in the second half in a 4-1 victory on Sunday to maintain their perfect La Liga start. Last season's treble winners lead the standings with 12 points ahead of three teams, including arch rivals Real Madrid, on 10, having won all of their four games so far. Defender Marc Bartra showed composure to open the scoring by converting a Messi cross after 50 minutes with Barca having been frustrated in the first half by a well organised Levante side. With the game having opened up, Neymar finished clinically after 55 minutes and won a penalty on the hour which was converted by Messi. At the other end, Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen flapped at a cross that allowed Victor Casadesus to slot the ball home after 65 minutes. Messi blazed a second penalty over the bar after he himself was fouled but the Argentine did score again with a drive from the edge of the area a minute from time. (Editing by Ken Ferris)

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- In the next few weeks, depending on a number of factors -- the health of the U.S. economy, the latest jobs numbers, the strength of the dollar and the pace of inflation -- the U.S. Federal Reserve may decide to increase interest rates. The decision, whatever it is, will have wide-ranging effects on the markets. In fact, the move to increase interest rates could itself be a crucial turning point for the entire U.S. economy and trigger a chain of events. It s been nine long years since the last increase, when the interest rates were increased by 25 basis points to 5.25% in June 2006. The intense financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 caused the toughest financial constraints on the U.S. economy since the Great Depression. In order to stabilize the economy, one of the actions taken by the Fed was to reduce the interest rate to zero. The aim through Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) was to push savers to become investors in order to jumpstart an ailing economy. Since 2008, the short-term interest rates have been kept close to zero in order to revive the economy, something that Japan resorted to in 1999 to curb deflation. Relevant actions related to Fed rates are taken depending on the situation of the economy. An increase in interest rates when the economy looks strong and decrease when economy faces recessionary conditions. Must Read: 15 Best Warren Buffett Quotes of All Time next last

NDBI chief executive Des Yaninen said the turnout of young people on the first day proved that there certainly was interest from youths to learn more about entrepreneurship and to learn the challenges in starting and running a business. Yaninen said the summit was also for youths to voice their concerns and for a collective participation from stakeholders to engage in addressing the challenges being faced. A highlight of the first day was the encouragement given to the participants by self-made businessman and Mul-Baiyer MP, Koi Trappe. Trappe, who started his own business from selling sweet potatoes to owning a wide range of trading and transport businesses, urged the youths to persevere and to start small but work hard. He added that there was a need for honest, young Papua New Guineans to own businesses to promote the growth of the SME sector in the country. The two-day summit ends today and would feature presentations, panel discussions as well as exhibits from various business houses in showcasing some of the initiatives that are in place to help small businesses.

Grilled stuffed squid is one of the most inviting grilled seafood there is. Be it in a seafood restaurant serving grilled specialties or just in the comfort of your home, the gastronomic lure of inihaw na pusit is too tempting to resist. The preparation is just simple - just stuff the squid with tomatoes and onions , add seasoning and then grill until ready. The trickiest part when cooking squid in general is how to avoid making it rubbery as overcooking it will make it that way. Here s a basic Grilled Stuffed Squid recipe that you can make easily at home. Ingredients Squid, medium to large size (just big enough to be stuffed)Tomato, diced/chopped (enough to stuff the squid)White Onion, diced/chopped (enough to stuff the squid)Onion leavesSalt Black pepper Dip CalamansiTomatoesOnionsChilisVinegarSoy sauceSugar Procedure Clean the squid, inside out. Remove the ink sac (you can use this to make your adobong pusit more black) and other entrails.Combine salt and pepper (and other seasoning that suit your taste like chili powder if you wan ta kick) then let the squid "bathe" in the mixture.In a separate container, mix tomato, onion and onion leaves. Season with salt and pepper.Insert the filling in the squid and make sure it is fully filled. Grill the squid for 4 to 6 minutes or until the front and backsides are cooked. Length of grilling depends on the size of your squid. Do not overcook.Serve with the dipping sauce - just combine the dip ingredients you can add or take away some of the ingredients to suit your taste. 
Tar_Heel_Rob/iStock/Thinkstock (NEW YORK) 〞 In an effort to ease travel demands on its players, the National Basketball Association has altered the format of its championship series. Now, the league says, the NBA Finals will eliminate its former Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday model to ensure that there will now be two days between game any time the teams change cities. The 2016 NBA Finals will begin on Thursday June 2. A potential Game Seven would take place on June 19, due in part to the new travel schedule. Earlier this summer, the league announced it would reduce the number of back-to-back games played by teams, as well as the number of times a team would have to play four game in five nights.

BELGRADE - Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic stated on Saturday that he is very happy that the Serbian people are not behaving as xenophobes and that the government is doing a responsible job with regard to the refugees from the Middle East, stressing that Serbia is the first country to register them and provide them with medical aid and facilities for overnight stay. Serbian Prime Minister said at a joint press conference with Norwegian Ambassador Arne Sannes Bjornstad that he expects that when the winter comes the refugees will be staying longer in Serbia and that Serbia endeavors to prepare reception centers. "I am pleased and proud to head a government that is behaving responsibly and that I am living in a country where people do not behave as xenophobes or believe in conspiracy theories," said Vucic. Bjornstad said Norway recognized the importance of reacting to the refugee crisis, adding that his country is impressed by the manner in which the people and the government here deal with the problem of refugees.

NORTH Melbourne will face West Coast in a preliminary final next weekend after accounting for Sydney by 26 points at ANZ Stadium on Saturday night. The Kangaroos threatened to blow the Swans away at certain stages throughout the match, however it remained a contest until midway through the final term. Jarrad Waite kicked three goals and Sam Gibson two for the visitors, while Kurt Tippett slotted two for the Swans. Ben Cunnington, Nick Dal Santo and Shaun Higgins won plenty of the Sherrin through the midfield. Adam Goodes was one of Sydney's best, but he is likely to come under scrutiny from the Match Review Panel for an incident with Scott Thompson. After falling to the ground in a tussle with Thompson, Goodes appeared to lash out at the North Melbourne defender with a kick. RE-LIVE THE ACTION FROM ANZ STADIUM IN OUR BLOG

Philip Ng Spotted Dining Out With Moon Lau By shirley on September 15, 2015 in NEWS Hong Kong artiste Philip Ng (斪埰) has recently been rumored with Moon Lau (〣憳h), the second runner-up in the 2013 Miss Hong Kong Pageant. The two not only carried the same style of luggage bags, but were also spotted eating out together near Philip's home. However, the 37 year-old martial artist denied the rumors via a telephone interview. Philip explained that he and Moon attended TVB's monthly birthday celebration for its artistes together, since both their birthdays are in September. At the event, they were photographed with the same style of luggage bags because it had been a prize from a draw. In terms of how the two were spotted dining together near Philip's home, he shared, "We met each other while filming a drama. It's normal to eat out with a friend! I had to work that day while Moon had some time off, so we decided to grab a bite near my place. She left right after we were done eating. I also returned to TVB for work after heading home to feed my dogs." Philip added the tabloid rumors have not affected his relationship with costars.

A young boy did the right thing over the weekend when he found $8,000 at a park in Salem, Massachusetts. Parents of Aiden Wright, 7, say they have always taught the boy to be honest. So when he found a checkbook with the money inside, he knew what to do. "I ran up the slide and at the top I looked at the corner and there was this black check book and I opened it up and I saw $8 thousand dollars in it and then I brought it to down my uncle." The owner, Elias Santos, says he is a contractor who had just been paid for a job. He was also at the park with his children when the checkbook apparently fell out of his pocket. "I am so grateful, you know, because we don t have people like this no more," says Santos. Also read: Gacy exhumations help identify another unrelated victim Source: foxsanantonio.com

Jamaica s prime minister has told supporters that her administration passed every test of the International Monetary Fund during the island s latest loan agreement. At the annual conference of the People s National Party, Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller touted the record of nine passed tests while calling the terms of the IMF deal "challenging yet necessary." She acknowledges employment rates are "not yet where we want them to be," but says Jamaica s economy is moving in the "right direction." The opposition disputes that. Jamaica has been trying to turn around its economy with a four-year, $930 million package with the IMF. In recent decades, Jamaica had one of the world s slowest growing economies. The party held its 77th annual conference Sunday at the island s National Stadium.

By ANI | ANI 每 Godhra (Gujarat), Sept.27 (ANI): A fire broke out at a steel company in Godhra, Gujarat, on Saturday, gutting scrap worth Rs.3 crores. A short circuit inside the godown of the steel company caused fire. Fire tenders took almost 12 hours to douse the flames that also took three stationary trucks loaded with scrap in its gambit. "Late night we got the information that A.K Traders Company had caught fire. Our staff including the fire tenders went to the site and started dousing the flames. Since the fire was huge we had called the fire brigade of the nearby areas as well. After 11-12 hours of working, we finally doused the fire," said fire officer, P F Solanki on Sunday. Steel company owner Phirdose Bhai Kothi blamed the delay in the arrival of fire service personnel for his loss. "The fire inside the scrap godown took place due to a short circuit and we asked for help from the municipality. Our loss could have been limited if the fire tenders would have reached the spot on time, but they did not," said Kothi. No causalities have been reported so far. (ANI)

Comment ﹞ print ﹞ T T T+﹞ T- The nextgen is looking at TECHNOLOGY-BASED ventures In the last few months, various forums have been created in Coimbatore to support start-ups. A host of activities have been planned around them such as presentation of awards to successful start-ups, etc. The city has more than 100 start-ups and most of these are in the ICT (Information and Communication Technology) space, though there are a few in industrial textiles, bio-medical and manufacturing verticals as well. Many Coimbatoreans, after their studies abroad, are returning to start their own ventures; there are students looking at using technology to make smart products; and there are several mobile app developers. The business incubators in the city are encouraging start-ups and innovations in a big way as are the centres of excellence for emerging sectors. The eco-system for becoming a hub for start-ups is gradually evolving in the city. According to an incubator manager, start-ups in the city now have organisations and facilities that they can approach for guidance. It is still not clear whether there will be growth of start-ups in specific verticals or if the ventures will be related to the traditional industries here. The reason why there are less start-ups in the manufacturing space is because of its typical challenges . There is a need for organisations and agencies that will help them overcome these challenges, find funding and encourage technology innovations. Every domain is now redefined by technology. So, there is ample scope for creating new products and businesses. (reporting by M. Soundariya Preeth

:33 "Moody's Investors Service has today confirmed Greece's government bond rating at Caa3 and changed the outlook to stable," the agency said in a statement issued Friday. "The key drivers behind the confirmation are the approval of the third bailout programme, and the emergence of a political configuration that is slightly more supportive than its predecessors for the implementation of reforms which the programme will require," it added. Moody's cut its credit rating for Greece to deep-junk 〞 jut two steps above "default" 〞 in July, shortly before a referendum on the terms of the third bailout. "Notwithstanding the positive developments the Caa3 rating continues to incorporate a high level of implementation risk given Greece's weak institutions and past poor track-record of implementing conditions of financial support," added the statement. Newly re-elected left-wing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said on Friday that Greece must "quickly implement" the terms of the tough EU bailout agreed in July. Tsipras won Sunday's general election, picking up between 33 and 35 percent of the vote. 2015 AFP
NEW research shows only one in five parents use safety restraints beyond seven years of age. Motor vehicle accident lawyer Genevieve Henderson said one of the leading causes of child death and acquired disability in Australia was motor vehicle crashes. "Up to 80 children are killed and thousands more injured in road crashes each year, and research shows a child in a car restraint is less likely to be harmed than one who is not," she said. "According to Australian road safety laws, all children up to the age of seven years must be safely restrained when travelling in a vehicle. "But one thing to remember is that the law sets out a minimum requirement only. "That means there is no reason why you cannot keep them in their restraints for longer- if they still fit, that is." - APN NEWSDESK.

Amy Schumer is ready for the next stage of her soaring career: writing a book. The Emmy Award-winning actress, filmmaker and comedian has a deal with Gallery Books for a memoir scheduled to come out in late 2016. The publisher told The Associated Press on Wednesday the book is currently untitled and is expected to "offer personal and observational stories from Schumer that range from the raunchy to the romantic, the heartfelt to the harrowing." "Believe it or not, there's actually more I have to say," Schumer, an artist known for telling all, said in a statement released through Gallery. Financial terms haven't been disclosed, although the deal is believed to be worth well into seven figures since publishers expect Schumer's book will likely enjoy the success of such previous works as Tina Fey's "Bossypants" and Amy Poehler's "Yes Please." So far this year, the 34-year-old Schumer has had a hit movie, "Trainwreck"; won an Emmy for best sketch comedy series; bonded with Jennifer Lawrence; and opened for Madonna at Madison Square Garden. She will host "Saturday Night Live" later this fall. "Now readers will have the opportunity to meet Amy Schumer as a writer of real talent, a daughter, a sister, and a young professional making her way in the world," Carolyn Reidy, president and CEO of Gallery's parent company Simon & Schuster, said in a statement.

Syracuse almost made a great play against LSU. (Almost.) LSU is playing at Syracuse. It s weird, but the Orange were bringing the fight early to the No. 6 Tigers. The Syracuse defense looked like they had wrapped up LSU quarterback Brandon Harris on this play... but he figured out how to get the ball to Leonard Fournette, and game over: After figuring out how to field the ball off his dang facemask, he sprinted downfield for a 48 yard gain. Great alertness by Harris to find Fournette as he was getting dragged down, good of Fournette to make himself available. He d dash into the end zone a few plays later. If you don t know about Leonard Fournette, please watch him destroy some people here.
Apple Music launched on June 30th . That means that those early adopters who signed up for the three-month free trial will have until the end of this month to make a monumental decision. Do they sign up at $9.99 per month ($14.99 monthly for a family of up to six), or do they call it quits with Apple Music for now. The most recent data shows that 11 million trial subscriptions were opened as of early August. Last month, Apple produced three ads to showcase new musical talent . Today, four new ads in the same vein have been released by the tech titan. Apple s YouTube tagline for the spots says it all, " Introducing artists you didn t know you couldn t live without. Discover and connect with new music and the people who make it - artists like Flo Morrissey ." You might not know any of these four artists now, and they might never become household names. But that doesn t mean that their music isn t worth listening to. Check out Flo Morrissey, Leon Bridges, Flying Lotus and Shamir by clicking on the video slideshow, below.

President Obama on Sunday dismissed Republicans opposed to same-sex marriage as ?living in another era, saying the national conversation had moved beyond whether gays and lesbians deserve equal marriage rights. And he lambasted statements made by GOP candidates as woefully out-of-touch with reality. "One of their leading candidates argued that going to prison turns you gay," Obama said, an apparent reference to Ben Carson, who had claimed that homosexuality in prison is proof that being gay is a choice. "I m just stating the facts," Obama continued. "Another candidate boasts that he introduced an amendment to end nationwide marriage equality. One said he loves the Constitution except for Article 3." The President said that "America has left the leaders of the Republican Party behind." "We need to reject politicians who are supporting new forms of discrimination as a way to scare up votes," he added. "That s not how we move America forward." During the event at Gotham Hall, which Democratic donors paid upwards of $33,400 to attend, Obama claimed Republican presidential contenders were pining for an era of economic failure. "In their world, everything was terrific back in 2008 when we were in the midst of a spiral into the worst financial crisis and economic crisis since the Great Depression, when unemployment and uninsured rates were rising and when our economy was shedding jobs each month, and we were mired in two wars, hopelessly addicted to foreign oil, and bin Laden was still at large," he said. "Those were the Golden Years, apparently.?"

We eagerly anticipate getting to the next station but, once we're there, we can't wait to move on. Much of life is a blur, like the views from a moving train.

Hints and tips for level 1187 Candy Crush Saga There are only 4 colours on the board so making special candies is not difficult. You can use some of the stripes that are given to hit the popcorns and grow them into colour bombs. It s unlikely you will be able to use all the popcorns and you shouldn t need to. Make stripes and colour bombs whenever you get the chance. The lucky candies may turn into colour bombs so try to get them next to a stripe first. If you can get the colour bomb/stripe combos first it will give you the stripes you need and also start to grow the popcorns to give you the colour bombs you need. In the video below I only managed to break on popcorn during polay, the rest of the colour bombs were made either by matching candies or from the lucky candies.

And Henderson looks to be enjoying a healthy dose of rest and recuperation ahead of Liverpool's trip to bitter rivals Manchester United on 12 September. The midfielder was named as permanent Liverpool captain after Reds legend Steven Gerrard move to LA Galaxy in the summer. Henderson has emerged as a key player for the Merseyside outfit over the past two seasons, scoring 10 goals in 72 Premier League games. The England man moved to Liverpool from Sunderland in a 20m deal in 2011. The post Photo: Injured Liverpool star Jordan Henderson posts holiday snap appeared first on The Sport Review .

Tigrayans never give any maneuvering room to those who disrespect you but fear to those who respect you. The leadership of Tigray must act in the interest of Tigray people and Tigrayans want to see the elimination of Shaebia more than anything right now. There is no reason for any Tigrayan specially the leadership of Tigray to think differently towards Shaebia unless that leader of Tigray is enemy of the people of Tigray. Shaebia does not have any respect or regard for the Tigray people, they have been working day and night to destroy Tigray and hand power to Amharu then why should anyone one called himself or herself hesitate to destroy Shaebia???

People walk with face covers at Jaffa Gate near the Tower of David in Jerusalem, Sept. 8, 2015, as a sandstorm hit across Israel. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) (JTA) 〞 Israel's ongoing sandstorm is the worst since before the founding of the state in 1948, according to the Israeli Environmental Protection Ministry. The sandstorm blanketing the region, which began Tuesday and is expected to continue through the weekend, has released the highest concentration of dust particles in more than 65 years, the Times of Israel reported Friday. The sandstorm has affected large swaths of Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Cyprus, and in Israel has led to record electricity consumption and air pollution highs. The previous electricity consumption record was set in August during a heatwave. Scientists are uncertain what caused the storm, with some saying it is related to agricultural disruptions caused by the Syrian civil war and others suggesting it stems from global warming, i24news reported. On Tuesday, air pollution in Jerusalem was 173 times higher than average; in the Negev, 51 times higher than average; and in the Galilee, 32 times higher than average, according to the Times of Israel. The Environmental Ministry has warned Israelis not to stay outside for extended periods. The storm has caused several respiratory-related deaths and hospitalized more than 2,500 in Lebanon, according to the Washington Post .

Removing old radiators can leave large holes in your wood floors. Fill these holes by using a plug cutter and you'll never notice a difference. Solid wood floors are a beautiful benefit of living in an old home, but many times they are marred by large holes near the baseboards that are left from the removal of old radiators and plumbing. To properly fill these holes, you need a plug cutter , a drill, and some spade bits or hole saws. It's also helpful if you can scrounge up a piece of replacement wood to cut the plug from.

WORLD No.3 Andy Murray looms as the man most likely to deny Australian veteran Lleyton Hewitt a Davis Cup fairytale. Murray will lead the Great Britain team into battle in this weekend s semi-final in Glasgow, and is heavily-favoured to win both his singles matches. Team captain Leon Smith has yet to announce which of his squad members will play in the other singles rubber tonight, with Kyle Edmund or the out-of-form James Ward the leading candidates. Australian captain Wally Masur has recalled world No.23 Bernard Tomic after he was left out of the quarter-final against Kazakhstan following pointed criticism of Tennis Australia at Wimbledon. If he can win one singles match, and possibly Thanasi Kokkinakis the other, the result of the tie will come down to the doubles. Smith will no doubt send out Murray and his brother Jamie, who has excellent doubles form this year, having made the final at both Wimbledon and the US Open. As he did against Kazakhstan, Masur will most likely play Hewitt and the big-serving Sam Groth after the pair pulled Australia out of a hole in the quarter-final. Hewitt, who would love to have a shot at winning the Cup one more time as a player before he takes over the captaincy next year, said he was up for the challenge. "Grothy and I teamed very well under massive pressure and got it done in July (against Kazakhstan), so we are going to be ready for the battle all weekend," the 34-year-old (pictured) said. - APN SPORTS BUREAU

guatepolitics: One in three deported migrants who took the survey reported some type of abuse or mistreatment by Border Patrol agents or while in Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody. Broken down by gender, 35 percent of women experienced abuse, versus 31.8 percent of men. For women, verbal abuse was the most common (20.3 percent), while men most frequently cited having their belongings taken and not returned (16.4 percent). Other reported issues included poor detention conditions (14.5 percent for men and women), physical abuse (12 percent), lack of food in detention (10.3 percent) and racial discrimination (8.4 percent). Despite the rampant mistreatment, the report found that just 7.7 percent of the survey respondents filed a complaint with U.S. immigration authorities, with many saying they didn't think it would matter and that they feared it would lead to retaliation. The survey also revealed that two out of three of the deported migrants who crossed into the U.S. with a family member were separated from at least one family member, including children, and found that this Border Patrol practice was associated with insecurity, financial difficulties and an increased chance of being abused after returning to Mexico. In addition, it found that 28 percent of those surveyed were deported at night, which put them at increased risk for violence.

A West of Scotland MSP, has called on the Scottish government to 'maximise the benefit' of funding for Faslane. Annabel Goldie questioned John Swinney, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment, and Sustainable Growth on what assessment the Scottish government has made of the economic benefits of HMNB Clyde being designated the UK's submarine centre of specialisation with a projected increase of 1,500 jobs by 2022. She said: "This announcement by the UK government with a 500 million pound investment to upgrade Faslane is tremendously important to the local economy and yet extraordinarily the SNP reaction has been at best muted, at worst hostile. "There is an exciting future for this part of Scotland and I have called on the Scottish government to maximise the benefit we can derive from this investment by engaging with the Ministry of Defence and the two local councils, West Dunbartonshire and Argyll and Bute, to ensure road infrastructure and public transport are adequate to meet increased demands and that training and job opportunities for young people at Faslane are maximised. "This a time for the Scottish government to work with the UK government not grin from the sidelines."

Deerfield Beach, FL -- (SBWIRE) -- 09/29/2015 -- The Global Bioherbicides Market accounted for $12.8 billion in 2014 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.46% reaching a value of $46.4 billion by 2022. The factors that are influencing the growth of the market are escalating demand for environmental friendly herbicides, low R&D costs, adoption of organic farming practices and growing demand for food safety & quality. Whereas, factors such as low consumer adoption of Biopesticides, risk of secreted metabolites by the microbes, high costs and low availability are restraining the growth of the market. However, advancements in genetic engineering, sustainable and integrated pest management techniques are considered as major opportunities for the market. Bioherbicide finds applications in crop control chemicals and leisure industry.
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader V S Achuthanandan has said that Labour Minister Shibu Baby John speaks like a businessman and he doesn't sound like an administrator who has certain commitments to the people and labourers. As a minister, Shibu has the liability to solve labour problems and ensure them their just rights and concessions. But, from the beginning, he has been taking sides with employers against the labourers. Shibu, who has been continuously speaking for KDHP company in Munnar is not fit to sit in the minster's chair. The minister's statement that tea plantation sector will paralayse if the labourers' wage is increased by Rs 500/person is an ample proof of this . " VS said in a statement. "According to the compromise formula made the last day, the plantation labour committee to meet on September 26 will take up the proposal to raise labourer wage by Rs 500. At this time, the minister himself coming out with the statement that the increment is a dangerous precedent will make situation favourable to the management. The decision taken in the meeting attended by the chief minister will also meet a dead end," he added.

Entertainment 18 September 2015 A visual treat for all rugby enthusiasts Known for years as the golden boy of SA rugby, the world reeled in shock in April 2011 when the news broke that Joost van der Westhuizen had been diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease (MND). The disease attacks the central nervous system, causing progressive disability. There is no known cure. The prognosis is death. Anyone who's seen Joost in action will know that he's not one to give up without a fight. His game-changing prowess as a rugby player is now galvanised in a battle for survival and, more importantly, to make a difference to the lives of others with the disease. Despite specialist assurances that he'd be in a wheelchair in a year and not likely see his 42th birthday, Joost not only celebrated in style, but took to the skies, travelling internationally with his J9 Foundation to meet the great minds who are working to find a cure.

Over a decade since the franchise started, The fifth Bourne movie is set to start shooting next week. After sitting out of the fourth movie in the series, The Bourne Legacy, Matt Damon will be returning to the title character in this movie that we don't know much about aside from this quote from Damon himself. "Without giving too much of it away, it's Bourne through an austerity-riddled Europe and in a post-Snowden world. It seems like enough has changed, you know? There are all these kinds of arguments about spying and civil liberties and the nature of democracy." It seems pretty logical for the Bourne series to go down this plot path and will hopefully add interest back into the franchise as The Borne Legacy was kind of given a "meh" response with Jeremy Renner as the lead character. Bourne 5 is scheduled to be released on July 29th 2016. You can read Damon's full interview here http://insidepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bourne.jpg
By | IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News 每 Paris, Sep 10 (IANS/EFE) States should host refugees until the conflict in their countries ends, said former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who is against the European mandatory refugee quotas, on Thursday. During an interview with La Figaro magazine, Sarkozy called for suspending free movement within the Schengen Area for non-Europeans through re-introducing border controls. The head of the conservative opposition also pointed out that the quota plan would only be acceptable if a common immigration policy is adopted, in order to avoid receiving immigrants, who do not correspond to the criteria set to enter France. Sarkozy said the European Union should create centres outside the Schengen Area to manage the demands of political refugee status and to protect those people who risk their lives to cross the Mediterranean. --IANS/EFE ml/dg

Several people were being held hostage in a Los Angeles-area restaurant late on Thursday after a suspected carjacker barricaded himself inside the building following a police chase, law enforcement and media reported. The suspect had holed up inside a barbecue restaurant in the city of Downey, in southeast Los Angeles, police said. A sergeant on duty would not say how many people were being held. Broadcasters KNBC and KCAl9 said six people were taken hostage. Video from the scene showed dozens of police cars and officers surrounding the building. The suspect is accused of carjacking two cars in Los Angeles on Thursday, media reported. The suspect led police on a high-speed chase that was captured on live television before the driver came to a stop at the Downey restaurant around 7:30 p.m. local time and jumped out - making a run for the building. Customers and staff fled the restaurant, KNBC said. Downey police would not give further details and declined to immediately give a description of the suspect.

Arlesey Town's recent good run in the Southern League Division One Central was halted in a game of three penalties on Tuesday, losing 3-1 at home to Royston Town. The Blues missed an early spot kick, and were made to pay in first half stoppage time when Ryan Ingrey lobbed Nick Thompson for Royston's opener. Rob Mason netted a penalty for the visitors early in the second period when Rhys Hoenes was fouled, but Jack Vasey pulled one back for Arlesey, finishing off after a good passing move. Then on 74 minutes Thompson brought down Hoenes, earning him a red card. Chris Watters stepped up to score and secure all three points. Arlesey now host Redbridge in the FA Trophy on Saturday.

If you plan to do any hiking this summer or fall, decorating your own walking sticks can be fun. All you need for this project is one 3/4∪ x 48∪ wooden dowel from the hardware store per person (No cutting or sanding required.), a variety of decorative Washi tape options, assorted gems and glue and any other decorations you desire. Cut pieces of duct tape (a corkboard duct tape was particularly popular with my kids)... and wrap around your stick. Leave the rest to your kids imaginations. You can use other materials to wrap around the stick and you can glue crystals or other items to the top of the stick. Now they are ready to use for hiking!
At the risk of public execution, has anybody considered the 2003 up Ford Crown Victoria IFS as a swap candidate for a B or C body ? Just looked over one stuck in a Ford 1/2 ton. That is a good looking setup. Tubular upper arms, power rack, & big anti lock brakes. I d love an Alternation or Magnum Force kit, but 5-6 K is too big a hit. Local yard has lots of CVs. Any thoughts out there ????. The post IFS swap appeared first on Classic Mopar Forums .
A HANGOVER which began early on Saturday morning is showing no signs of going anywhere late into Sunday. The hangover, which began at 5AM on Saturday when mechanic Wayne Hayes stumbled out of bed to urinate, was expected to depart later that day but has instead taken up a more permanent residence. Hayes said: "I tried to sleep it off. I've tried absorbing it with carbs. I watched an entire black-and-white film about WWII frogmen with the curtains drawn. "By 5pm on Saturday, as I lay shivering on the settee unable to cope with with the volume off, I accepted I'd have to write off the day and make a fresh start tomorrow. "But when I woke this morning, my stomach aching from the poison, that dull ache behind my eyes still flaring whenever it sees sunlight, I realised that this one was a two-part epic on the scale of the films." All plans to leave the house abandoned, Hayes plans to treat his hangover to regular doses of extra-strength paracetamol, a six-pack of pickled onion Monster Munch and plenty of fizzy drinks. He said: "My mistake was trying to get rid of the hangover. I've moved on from that now. "This is the hangover's weekend. I'm just a passenger." For more detail please click here

(Mumbai) - The EUR/USD received a boost from the spike in the EUR/GBP pair following a horrible UK trade deficit data and weak industrial production figures. Hourly 200-MA put to test The spot is once again flirting with the hourly 200-MA currently located at 1.1201 levels. The Euro has struggled to sustain above the same, at least six times in the last 24 hours or so. It remains to be seen if the spot finally manages to extend gains over and above its hourly 200-MA. The latest uptick came on the back of a 40-pip spike in the EUR/GBP to near 0.73 levels. Meanwhile, the European stocks have consolidated slightly below the daily highs. Any sign of weakness in the European or US equities may add to the EUR's strength. EUR/USD Technical Levels The spot currently trades around 1.12 levels. A break above 1.1201 (hourly 200-MA) could see the spot target 1.1230 (previous day's high). On the flip side, support is seen at 1.1175 (hourly 50-MA) and 1.1147 (daily low).

This is a step that is absurdly easy, yet very powerful, in building confidence and changing how I feel about myself, especially when I am discouraged. It works not just for dieting but for life in general. And here it is: Give Yourself Credit. Recognize when you do something well and give yourself credit for doing the right thing. No matter how small or seemingly insignificant, take note and celebrate every win, no matter how small. You are that much closer to achieving your goals. By focusing on these positive changes and reinforcing them, you will feel more optimistic and empowered about current and future success at weight loss and weight management. This helps make the changes "stick" and become second nature and permanently replace old, negative attitudes. Similar to this step, Weight Watchers leaders talk a lot about NSVs or Non-Scale Victories but are usually referring to more tangible accomplishments. These are clearly important at helping stay on track. The Beck concept goes a little deeper by recognizing changes to thinking that may have contributed to weight gain or lack of success at losing weight in the past. I will be the first to admit that making a big deal about praising myself for accomplishing something small feels silly and uncomfortable at first (yay, me! I remembered to take my vitamins this morning!) but with practice it does get easier. And you know what? It does feel good.

Consumer Price Inflation, August 2015: ONS The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) was unchanged in the year to August 2015, that is, a 12-month rate of 0.0%, down from 0.1% in the year to July 2015. A smaller rise in clothing prices on the month compared with a year ago was the main contributor to the slight fall in the rate. There were also downward effects from changes in motor fuel prices and sea fares. Rising prices for soft drinks and for furniture and furnishings partially offset the fall.
Posted Thursday, September 17th 2015 @ 3pm by James Dinh If you were still inkling for more Taylor Swift covers courtesy of Ryan Adams , then today is your lucky day. On Thursday afternoon (September 17), the singer/songwriter unveiled his take one on "Bad Blood," and it s quite the mellow contrast from the original Max Martin -produced cut. For his interpretation, Ryan removed all the bass-heavy vibes of the stomping pop anthem and turned into an almost somber guitar-backed tune, which evokes all the sads about a broken relationship. We aren t the only ones impressed with his rendition of "Bad Blood" either. Shortly after the track made its way to the blogosphere, Tay took to Twitter to share her appreciation for the project. Ryan s music helped shape my songwriting. This is surreal and dreamlike.

The attack happened on the River Chess towpath off Scots Hill at around 11.45am on Wednesday, September 2.

So you say you like skateboarding. And turkeys. Luckily, you've come to the right place, because we've got a turkey-boarding combination that, we surmise, goes together as well as mashed potatoes and gravy: the first filming collaboration of SNOWBOARDER Art Director, David "Davidaisy" Steigerwald and SNOWBOARDER intern/ The Hart Beat columnist (and younger brother to Ian Hart ), Brendan Hart . For weeks, when arguably Brendan should have been working late in the office, Dave and he would head to the desolate streets outside the SNOWBOARDER building where Brendan would battle with a variety of complex skateboard maneuvers and Dave would capture it all on film每scratch that每on his iPhone with the aid of a Deathlens. It makes sense, really. Dave is a talented painter and designer and Brendan is an up and coming wordsmith, so naturally they decided to film a skate edit. Their video debut exceeds all expectations and has plenty of gobbles and clucks (see: Hart's Turkey Farm). We're excited for the next collab video, though we hear it's on a five-year filming schedule.
I m not as much drawn to sports as when considerably younger, but even then, I was particularly drawn to those who transcended their sport, who exhibited signs of life beyond their sport, those who either impacted life head on like an Ali, or simply displayed a certain sense of irony or humor as in the case of Yogi Berra (to whom one can attribute the quote above). And speaking of astute observations, particularly when it comes to life and its passing moments on the streets we tread daily, the name of photographer Cristophe Agou most certainly comes to mind- a good tribute here. Thanks, and RIP guys...
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to Lt. Governor Najeeb Jung, terming as "unconstitutional" his order to demolish shanties in the capital. Kejrwal said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished 40 shanties in south Delhi s Mehrauli area on August 26 on the order of Jung, who is the chairman of the land-owning agency. "Through this letter, I want to tell you that on one hand, these jhuggis were demolished in violation of the Constitution, and on the other, to make the poor of this country homeless is against humanity," Kejriwal wrote. In the three-page letter in Hindi dated August 29, the chief minister invoked a law to drive his point home. "In 2014, parliament enacted a law. Its name was Delhi Special Provision Act 2014. According to this law, a structure which came up before January 1, 2006 cannot be demolished," the letter said. "There is also a provision in this law that demolition can be carried out in case there is encroachment upon roads or the government urgently needs land for its projects," it added. "Under the law, demolition can only be carried out if the concerned agency has made arrangements of rehabilitation. On August 26, the DDA demolished shanties of people without arrangements of their rehabilitation," Kejriwal said. The chief minster said he was in the know that more demolitions were to take place.

Right tackle Mike Remmers is the Carolina Panthers' backup plan at center should starter Ryan Kalil experience a setback with his sprained knee this week. The Panthers open the season at Jacksonville on Sunday. Remmers hasn't played the position since seventh grade. But after getting reps there during OTAs, Remmers went home to Oregon during the summer and received some tips from one of his former teammates at Oregon State. "He played center so he kind of helped me out a little bit this offseason. I've been doing a little snapping after practice," Remmers said Monday. "I try not to think about it when you're playing because I feel like that's when bad snaps happen. You've got to be natural and just do it." When Remmers is at center, rookie Daryl Williams takes his place at right tackle. Williams had a strong preseason, drawing praise from Panthers coach Ron Rivera for his work against Miami's defensive linemen during the joint practices with the Dolphins last month. Versatile lineman Chris Scott is the Panthers' third-team center.
PHOENIX -- Shots have been fired at four vehicles on Interstate 10 in Phoenix since Saturday morning and authorities are trying to determine if the incidents are connected. "Somebody knows something," Arizona Department of Public Safety Director Frank Milstead said at a news conference Monday. "We re not sure if these shootings are random or related. We don t know what the intent is. It s not known at this point if it s a copy-cat crime." One person suffered a non-life threatening injury as a result of one of the shootings, according to authorities. Milstead said his department is appealing to the public for information from anybody who saw anything unusual on the freeway during the periods when the shots were fired. "You should be concerned. We have some people or person shooting at moving vehicles on I-10," Milstead said. "It has not ended in tragedy, but it could." Two vehicles were struck in a half-hour span around 11 a.m. Saturday on I-10 between 19th and 59th avenues and a third vehicle was hit on I-10 near 16th Street about 10:15 p.m. Saturday, according to the DPS. A fourth vehicle was shot at around 4:25 a.m. Monday near 14th Avenue and I-10. A tour bus and an SUV were two of the vehicles fired upon, but DPS is withholding other specifics so their investigation won t be jeopardized. The bullets have hit a windshield and a headlight and the rest have been side impacts on the passenger sides of the vehicles, Milstead said.
Everyone deserves the opportunity to work hard for a living. The modern tragedy is that not everyone who wants to work is able to find work[1], even if they take all the right steps[2], and those who find work often have to settle for less pay than they deserve[3]. But a greater tragedy looms before us: those who have work are slowly being replaced by next-generation robots.

Dick Fuld is leaving Sun Valley 〞 and he's more than $20 million wealthier as he heads out of town. The former CEO of Lehman Brothers, who led the Wall street bank as it cratered into the largest bankruptcy ever, sold his 71.3-acre ranch on Thursday night in the famously tony Idaho ski resort town. While the final sale price was not released, it "represents the highest sale price of any property in Sun Valley, Chad Roffers, chairman of Concierge Auctions, which oversaw the sale, told The Post. Fuld, 69, has been trying to sell his home on Big Wood River Drive in Ketchum for more than a year, mostly through private appointments, The Post first reported in June. The disgraced banker had been looking for as much as $59.5 million, according to an earlier listing from Concierge Auctions. This time, there were scant details about the auction, except that the opening bid was $20 million and the winner was from the Pacific Northwest. The 29-minute auction featuring six bidders was "very competitive," Roffers said. It was held in the family room of the main property, where there's a pool table, and a fireplace. Fuld was not there for the auction, Roffers said. The sale, which will take another 60 days to close, is the highest price fetched for a residential property at auction ever 〞 beating the previously held record of $19.25 million.

:15 Assailants riding on a motorcycle opened fire on a police car outside a hospital and then fled, the Dogan press agency said. One died instantly and the second died after emergency surgery, it said, quoting the local governor, Mustafa Buyuk. "Early indications are that it was an attack by the terrorist organisation," Buyuk said, in a reference to the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The Turkish government launched a major campaign against the PKK in late July, aimed at forcing it out of strongholds in southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq. The group has hit back hard, killing dozens of police and soldiers in almost daily bomb and shooting attacks. Nearly 150 soldiers and police have been killed in attacks since July blamed on the PKK compared with more than 1,300 rebels, according to pro-government media. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democracy Party (HDP) says dozens of civilians have been killed in police and military operations. The escalation comes ahead of snap elections on November 1. The violence has shattered a two-year-ceasefire which had stoked hopes of an end to the PKK's three-decade insurgency, in which more than 40,000 people have died. 2015 AFP

Last week we began talking about how good readers infer. We explain it to students by telling them that inferring means we read between the lines. We understand the implied message by using two things: our own prior or background knowledge of the subject (our schema) the clues the author has provided in the text or pictures I m looking forward to reading the boys and girls this simple, but funny story called, I Want My Hat Back by Jon Klassen. It usually takes a moment at the end, but the kids soon infer just what happened to the rabbit in the story. I found this funny photo online last year. I ll show it to the class on Monday and ask, "What do you infer?" If you have never had or heard of pumpkin-pie, an inference would be hard here but if you have enjoyed making or eating pumpkin-pie, you likely know exactly why Senor Pumpkin looks a little concerned. Please review this photo with your child and discuss the two factors that help us to infer messages in what we read and view. 
 . In the very earliest time, when both people and animals lived on earth, a person could become an animal if he wanted to and an animal could become a human being. Sometimes they were people and sometimes animals and there was no difference. All spoke the same language. That was the time when words were like magic. The human mind had mysterious powers. A word spoken by chance might have strange consequences. It would suddenly come alive and what people wanted to happen could happen〞all you had to do was say it. Nobody can explain this: That s the way it was. 每Nalungiaq Nalungiaq was an Inuit woman interviewed by ethnologist Knud Rasmussen in the early twentieth century. . Alex Saberi .
Mortgage credit availability increased in August according to the Mortgage Credit Availability Index, a report from the Mortgage Bankers Association which analyzes data from Ellie Mae's AllRegs Market Clarity business information tool. The MCAI increased 0.5% to 126.1 in August. "Mortgage credit availability increased in August and has increased in eight of the last nine months," said Mike Fratantoni, MBA's Chief Economist. "While much of the loosening has been for jumbo loan products, the availability of conforming conventional mortgage credit has also somewhat increased, including for mortgages with higher loan-to-value ratios and borrowers with lower credit scores. "Fannie Mae recently announced changes to their affordability suite of products, but these changes have not yet impacted the MCAI," he said. Click to enlarge (Source: MBA) A decline in the MCAI indicates that lending standards are tightening, while increases in the index are indicative of loosening credit. The index was benchmarked to 100 in March 2012. Of the four component indices, the Jumbo MCAI saw the greatest loosening (up 0.7% over the month) followed by the Conventional MCAI (up 0.5%), the Government MCAI (up 0.4%), and the Conforming MCAI (up

This document contains proposed regulations relating to certain transfers of property by United States persons to foreign corporations. The proposed regulations affect United States persons that transfer certain property, including foreign goodwill and going concern value, to foreign corporations in nonrecognition transactions described in section 367 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The proposed regulations also combine portions of the existing regulations under section 367(a) into a single regulation. In addition, in the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal Register, temporary regulations are being issued under section 482 to clarify the coordination of the transfer pricing rules with other Code provisions. The text of those temporary regulations serves as the text of a portion of these proposed regulations.
An estimated $11tn has been wiped off value of world shares amid growing concerns over China's flagging economy Global markets are heading for their worst quarterly performance since the depths of the eurozone crisis in 2011, with an estimated $11tn ( 7tn) wiped off the value of world shares, despite an attempted rebound on the last day of September. After a summer of wild swings, sparked by growing fears of a slowdown in China, leading shares have slumped from the record highs of a few months earlier, and are on track for their second quarterly decline in a row.

Via Quora (Post by Nathan Coppedge): "I think a variable is more general than a particle, and much more specific than a field. But, nonetheless, it has a kind of universal relevance in our world. Relevance is a variable that extends beyond the bounds of time. And some worlds may even look similar, in a superficial way, when they are immortal. But we have to measure up before we get there (my spiritual view is Asceticurean, meaning that I practice Zen aesthetics, urbanism, and epiphanies, as rituals and a form of life. It also involves taking things lightly, with an eye to universal intelligence)."

A total of 84% of parents believe smartphones help bolster their children's education. These parents feel that screens are a good distraction for their children when they are busy or tired. A poll of more than 1,000 parents carried out by ComRes for Channel 4 News found that the average British child spends more than two hours and 56 minutes in front of screens every day. 54% of children use screens mainly to play games, with 38% mainly watching videos on YouTube. A quarter of parents suggest social media is one of the three most common uses, while 19% say their children mostly use screens for school and homework. In a Europe-wide study of how families cope with young children's screen time, it was found that British, Belgian and German parents were more restrictive, whereas Finnish and Czech parents were more easy-going. The research reveals that the majority of parents use their phones regularly in front of their children, and use access to screens as a way of rewarding or punishing their children's behaviour.

Let s be bold and beautiful. It s time to get bold about the 2015 Jets. Let s put together some Bold Predictions for this season. Disclaimer: A Bold Prediction is not something that is likely or probable to happen. Bold Predictions are guesses that are beyond what anyone can reasonably expect to happen, but not so far as to be virtually impossible. Saying that Chris Ivory will run for 4300 yards and 48 touchdowns is not a Bold Prediction, nor is saying that Muhammad Wilkerson will get 5+ sacks. By definition, Bold Predictions are unlikely, but not impossible, to occur. So let s get to it. 1. The Jets will finish in the top five in the NFL in terms of least sacks allowed for the season. 2. The Jets defense will finish in the top three in both yards and points allowed (not counting points given up by the offense or special teams, such as pick sixes or kickoff return TDs). 3. The Jets will have two 1000 yard receivers for the first time since Wayne Chrebet and Keyshawn Johnson pulled it off in 1998. 4. The Jets will make the playoffs for the first time since 2010. 5. Chris Ivory will rush for more yards in 2015 than any player in Jets history other than Curtis Martin. And a bonus prediction: the Jets will finish ahead of the Patriots in the final regular season standings. What about you? What are your Bold Predictions for the Jets in 2015?
A Russian court has thrown out two lawsuits against the makers of German TV documentaries which alleged that doping was widespread in Russian athletics. The lawsuits were filed by Russia s athletics federation and its ex-president Valentin Balakhnichev, who doubles as the treasurer of the IAAF, athletics world governing body. They claimed their "honor and dignity" had been damaged by films made by German TV channel ARD, which alleged that some federation officials encouraged Russian athletes to dope and that anti-doping officials covered up positive tests to protect star Russian athletes. Russian media reported that both lawsuits were rejected by the court in the city of Samara with no reasoning given. Artyom Patsev, a lawyer representing both Balakhnichev and the federation, told Russia s Tass agency that he was appealing both rulings.

Back to school and back to cooking and blogging! I am always looking for one-dish meals that I can prep in the afternoon and pop into the oven when it s time to eat. This Hoisin Shrimp with Bok Choy, Shiitakes and Peppers didn t disappoint. Roasted bok choy is a real treat - it was crispy and savoury and paired well with shrimp and other vegetables. Since all the ingredients go together over parchment paper, this was an easy clean-up as well. I didn t have shiitake mushrooms on hand, so I used other vegetables I had in the fridge - you could clean up your fridge with this recipe and add whatever needs to be used up. Within 20 minutes, you ve got dinner! Source: Family Circle magazine, September 2015
T uesday was the official first day of fall and if night-time temps continue to drop, shad will begin to move into flats and backs of coves. On some of our area lakes, this begins the migration of baitfish with bass coming right behind them. Right now, as bad as we want this to begin, it all depends on the fish. If you fished this past weekend on any of our area lakes, you noticed most of the bass are still in their summer patterns and so are the shad, but something is going on that I don't understand. These fish in their summer patterns are not biting very well. Subscription Required An online service is needed to view this article in its entirety.

The Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is looking to hire airfield staff following a $735,000 fine from the Federal Aviation Administration. The airport was fined for violating an agreement that it would adequately staff snow removal teams and de-ice runways during storms. The FAA found the violations led to snow and ice accumulating on the runways, causing pilots to refuse to land and diverting arrivals to other airports. The Northeast Ohio Media Group reports (http://bit.ly/1ioUeVR ) that the city will start accepting applications Saturday for maintenance workers, field unit leaders, airport operations agents and heavy-duty technicians. City spokesman Dan Williams says Cleveland must hire seasonal snowplow operators, too. He says the airport currently has 25 part-time snowplow drivers and needs 46 to meet minimum-staffing requirements under an agreement with the FAA.
By Aleksandar Vasovic OPATOVAC, Croatia (Reuters) - Croatia said on Wednesday it would lift border restrictions with Serbia only once Belgrade begins sending migrants to Hungary, standing firm against a midnight deadline when Serbia says it will retaliate. Zagreb has banned all trucks but those carrying perishable goods from entering from fellow ex-Yugoslav republic Serbia and has shut seven of eight road border crossings, angry that its neighbor is sending tens of thousands of migrants across their joint border rather than to neighboring Hungary or Romania. The dispute is fast becoming their most serious in the two decades since Croatia fought Belgrade-backed Serb rebels in a 1991-95 war to forge its independence from socialist Yugoslavia.
Marcelo admits referee Jose Martinez Munuera may have mistakenly disallowed Youssef El-Arabi's goal for Granada against Real Madrid on Saturday. The forward appeared to have given the Andalucians the lead in the first half, when he got in front of his marker and finished off a low cross, only for the linesman to adjudge the move offside and Martinez Munuera to permit the use of a flag. "We started off with some chances but they had some too," the left-back said after the game. "We managed to score a goal in the end, and that helped us a lot to get the three points. "[On El-Arabi's disallowed goal], everyone has the right to make a mistake, including referees and players. "We're not prepared to discuss whether the referee was good or bad. Those issues must stay on the pitch. "[On booing in the first half], the fans are entitled to help us or boo us. "We're obliged to play good football, but what matters the most are the three points. "When the team aren't doing well, it's normal that the fans are impatient." Follow Football Espana on
Director Ridley Scott has shared a wealth of information on Prometheus 2 during his press tour for The Martian. Having confirmed the presence of multiple sequels in the pipeline, all meant to eventually sync up with his 1979 masterpiece, Alien , Scott has started calling the upcoming film Alien: Paradise Lost. Scott spilled the beans chatting with Hey U Guys. "Actually, really, it s going to be called Alien: Paradise Lost ," he explains "so Prometheus 2 s not really gonna be." He went on to reference John Milton s classic literary poem of the same name, but jokes that the only parallel is its intellectual title. [embedded content] When asked to elaborate further Scott let slip a few key details on what the film would explore, such as the origin of the ferocious xenomorph. "We re heading back to why and how and when the beast was invented. We ll go back in to the back door of the very first Alien that I did nearly thirty years ago." That s interesting kernel of knowledge, especially when Scott himself stated last year that the Prometheus sequel would not feature any xenomorphs and introduce a fresher form of alien. As yet Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender are the only confirmed cast members reporting for duty in February 2016, when shooting is scheduled to begin. Before then you can expect to hear more from Scott on the sequel and Neill Blomkamp s Alien 5 - which Scott is producing - in the near future. Alien: Paradise Lost opens on May 30, 2

NEWBURY'S parkrun is now the proud owner of a life-saving device. The running group, which meets weekly at Greenham Common, received an automated external defibrillator (AED) on Saturday. The device can recognise the symptoms of cardiac arrest and deliver the vital electric shock to restore a regular heart rhythm. Defibrillators are designed to be used by people who have had no first-aid training. The Newbury parkrun AED was funded by donations from runners and local commercial heating and air conditioning company Southern Maintenance Solutions UK LTD. The manager at Southern Maintenance Solutions, Terry Tarbox, said: "We, as a local company, think it's important to support this fantastic free event. I personally feel it's essential to have an AED at these type of events. "My wife, children, parents and friends run Newbury parkrun and you never know when or who will need this first response device." Parkrun event director David Smith said that having a defibrillator on hand was important, as a cardiac arrest can affect anyone. Highlighting the importance of the device, Mr Smith said: "When not being used at parkrun, we have decided to make the AED available to local activities and sporting events free, for the benefit of the whole West Berkshire community." Newbury parkrun is a weekly, timed, 5km run for anyone who wants to join in. Runners meet at 9am at Greenham Common every Saturday and regularly attract more than 400 people.

Dean Hammond could be heading out of Leicester City on loan. The experienced midfielder has fallen down the pecking order at City since the arrivals of N Golo Kante and Gokhan Inler, and has made just one appearance, captaining the side to victory at Bury in the Capital One Cup. Several clubs have made enquiries about Hammond s availability, especially now the loan window is open. League One side Sheffield United are among the clubs monitoring Hammond s situation. City boss Claudio Ranieri is considering whether to allow Hammond to head out on loan. City also have Andy King and Danny Drinkwater to choose from in central-midfield areas but, although Matty James is progressing well after his knee surgery, Ranieri said he could still be out for another two to three months. "He has started to join in the warm-up before training, which is important for us," said Ranieri. "But he needs another three months." Hammond, who has made 20 starts and 25 substitute appearances since joining City from Southampton for an undisclosed fee in 2013, signed a new one-year contract in the summer.
The International Psychotherapy Institute (IPI) has created a website, freepsychotherapybooks.org where there is free downloading of titles in psychotherapy, psychiatry and psychoanalysis. New York City - September 18, 2015 - ( Newswire.com ) The International Psychotherapy Institute (IPI) has created a website: reepsychotherapybooks . org , where there is FREE access to titles in psychotherapy, psychiatry and psychoanalysis. Around 1440 Johannes Gutenberg devised a printing system that made books far less expensive than handwritten manuscripts and changed the world. Free ebooks will do the same. Ebooks have no costs for paper, printing, binding, warehousing, or shipping, and, since in return for vast distribution, our authors are willing to give up royalties, our ebooks are free. Readers in 218 countries have already downloaded over 500,000 ebooks . Soon there will be millions. Just with Gutenberg many others will follow this publishing model. Free ebooks will change the world. According to author Lawrence Hedges, PhD, "The distribution of my books has reached the tens of thousands throughout the world which far exceeds distribution of all the rest of my books put together over a 30- year period."

Both Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) said they will back Price, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, over House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA). "Tom Price is a committed conservative and a good friend," Ryan, chair of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement, according to Politico. "He and I have served for years together on the Budget and Ways and Means Committees, working to pay down our debt, fix our tax code, and grow our economy. Tom has a proven record of advancing conservative solutions and principles. He has the knowledge and skills needed to be an effective Majority Leader, and I'm proud to support him." Hensarling, who had been mulling a bid for a leadership position, announced on Monday that he would not run and threw his support behind Price. "After prayerful consideration, Chairman Hensarling is not a candidate for a leadership position. He will support Chairman Price for Majority Leader," Hensarling spokeswoman Sarah Rozier told Politico. Price, the former chair of the House Republican Study committee, after former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) lost his seat, and instead sought out the position of Budget Committee chairman.
 failing , issues , Janata Durbar , Jharkhand , meet , Ministers Ranchi, Sep 2 (IANS) Jharkhand's ministers are failing to turn up at the "Janata Durbar" (public meet) called by Chief Minister Raghubar Das on every Wednesday.

We are disappointed as the minister was absent from the Janta Durbar," said Kedar Nath Singh. Marandi told reporters: "We are part of the government and the issue will be sent to concerned department."

John Gosden insists ground on the easy side of good would not be a major issue for Qipco Irish Champion Stakes favourite Golden Horn. Golden Horn: Won t mind softer ground The Investec Derby and Coral-Eclipse hero saw his unbeaten record go up in smoke at York last month as he suffered a shock defeat at the hands of David Elsworth s filly Arabian Queen. Provided conditions are not deemed too testing, the Cape Cross colt will head to Leopardstown on Saturday week for what will be his first appearance on Irish soil. Gosden said: "He s quite capable of racing on an easier surface, he just doesn t want ground that s gone very dead. "I d just like to see good, or good to soft ground, that ll be fine.

Media outlets report that 68-year-old Richard E. Paulus was indicted Thursday on one count of health care fraud and 26 counts of making false statements relating to health care matters. According to the indictment, Paulus schemed to defraud and obtain money from Medicare, Medicaid and other insurers. The indictment says Paulus sold his practice to King s Daughters Medical Center in 2008 and then worked under an agreement with the hospital to do heart procedures. The indictment says Paulus billed Medicare for more heart catheterization and stent procedures than any other cardiologist in the nation from 2006 to 2011. Paulus attorney, Robert S. Bennett, said the charges are baseless and unfair.

VANCOUVER 每 Local governments in British Columbia have declared they have the authority to licence medical marijuana dispensaries, defying the federal government's opposition to any regulation of the illegal stores. Delegates at the Union of B.C. Municipalities voted strongly in favour of a resolution to endorse the position that they have the power to regulate dispensaries. The resolution says that an ongoing court challenge of Ottawa's medical marijuana laws has created uncertainty while pot shops proliferate and cause problems in B.C. Maple Ridge Coun. Corisa Bell says the rapid growth of the stores has had a negative economic impact but they could contribute to local economies with proper regulation. Vancouver recently became the first city in Canada to regulate its 100 marijuana shops, imposing a $30,000 licence fee and requiring them to locate 300 metres from schools, community centres and each other. Selling pot over the counter is illegal in Canada, and the federal government recently sent letters to 13 dispensaries warning of RCMP raids if they did not shut down.

Frederick County State s Attorney Charlie Smith said Friday that orders like the one filed Tuesday typically require an evaluation within 90 days. The order applies to 30-year-old Song Su Kim of Falls Church, Virginia. The Korean-American man has pleaded not criminally responsible for the July 26 attack on 63-year-old Chung Hwan Park and 57-year-old Ae Suk Ko of Suwon, South Korea.

By Marine lubricants and greases provider Total Lubmarine informs it has resumed all services based out of the Port of Tianjin following the deadly explosions that rocked the port August 12. The company, which operates in more than 1,000 ports worldwide, said the explosions cause it only minor disruption as its warehouse and delivery agent facility remained undamaged, although the port s customs building has been badly impacted. Total Lubmarine s services at the port, though fully resumed, are subject to four working days notice instead of three, and services for vessels calling at the port itself are subject to two working day s notice - the same as before the explosions. Total Lubmarine said its delivery managers are in contact with all customers taking on lubricants at the port of Tianjin and nearby ports Caofeidan, Huanghua, Jing Tang, Qinhuangdao, Shanhaiguan and Tangshan.

WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) 〞 It's "Manufacturing Week" across the Tar Heel State, and Commerce Secretary John Skvarla came to the Port City to tour one example. Skvarla said IKA Works in Wilmington, a laboratory equipment manufacturer, is just one of many that provides almost 450,000 jobs in the state. Recently, Gov. Pat McCrory's bond proposal aimed for more than $1 billion in transportation improvements , among other projects in the state, was changed by the General Assembly to focus more on capital projects for colleges and community colleges. State lawmakers and a governor's office spokesman said the new budget does have money allotted for transportation , which Skvarla said is a start. "The answer is we are getting some, maybe not as much as the governor wanted, but it's not zero, so we will be able to make progress and invest in the areas we need to invest," Skvarla said. Skvarla added the state will remain competitive in all areas to keep bringing economic development here. Both Skvarla and McCrory will be touring manufacturers this week to celebrate "Manufacturing Week."

In light of the launch of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which is rolling out across the other side of the globe right now, Apple has updated its official Apple Store iOS app. With the update, which is available now, the app is now version 3.5, and with it comes first and foremost compatibility improvements to iOS 9. Considering that Apple has not only launched iOS 9 proper this month, but iOS 9.0.1 as well, some users may have experienced issues with the app on the latest software, and this is meant to alleviate those issues. On top of that, there's support for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, too, which, at this point, doesn't really tell us anything. If that means 3D Touch will be supported in the app, that would be worthwhile. Perhaps the app's icon can be accessed via 3D Touch as well. A link to the app is below.

Australia is set to abandon the Abbott government s position that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must step aside as part of any durable peace settlement, it s been reported. The major policy shift is aimed at hastening the end of the bloody civil war in Syria, The Australian reported on Saturday. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the newspaper there was an emerging consensus that the Assad regime would likely be pivotal in fortifying the Syrian state and preventing further gains by the Islamic State group. "It is evident there must be a political as well as a military solution to the conflict in Syria," she said, noting that Australia would play its part in achieving that. "There is an emerging view in some quarters that the only conceivable option would be a national unity government involving President Assad." But Ms Bishop said the specific role and duration of President Assad s involvement would likely be temporary.
Getty Images The hip injury suffered by Lions linebacker DeAndre Levy remains a concern, but that's his only health concern. An odd rumor surfaced this week that Levy was suffering from the effects of a parasite that he picked up on vacation in Chile during the offseason. But Levy's agent, Joe Panos, told Ian Rapoport of NFL Network that the rumors aren't true. "Completely, 100 percent false," Panos told Rapoport. Dave Birkett of the Detroit Free Press reports that Lions coach Jim Caldwell took a moment out of practice this morning to ask reporters where the parasite story came from. The team seems to be taken by surprise by the whole thing. The Lions still think the muscle strain in Levy's hip will be a short-term injury, although he's out of practice again today and likely to miss his second consecutive game when the Lions visit Minnesota on Sunday.

Last week's price volatility in crude oil prompted a Reuters analyst to opine that the action "should convince even the most die-hard believers [that] the oil futures market is neither efficient nor rational." But efficient or rational compared to what? Markets are indeed the most inefficient and irrational way to allocate scarce resources like oil〞except for all the other ways. In fact, based on the oil-price volatility index, or OVX, tracked by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, last week's turbulence, while extreme, was not off the charts in terms of the past few years. According to Steve Briese, editor of the Bullish Review of Commodity Insiders, the push and pull of buying-and-selling pressure that creates such choppiness often signals that the price trend is at a crossroads＃＃＃＃＃＃＃＃＃＃＃＃＃＃＃..
WORK is underway to replace a stretch of pavement on the High Street. Pavement works could last up to eight weeks. Work on the next phase of footway replacement between Gordon Street and the council office at Auchernack began on Monday (September 28) and is expected to take approximately eight weeks. Existing concrete footways will be replaced by coloured concrete block paving, continuing the red/grey theme originally agreed with representatives from the community council. While the work 每 which will be undertaken from east to west in two main sections 每 is underway, a safe working zone will be established on the northern footway, with traffic lights in operation to restrict traffic to the south side of the High Street. This will require the implementation of temporary parking restrictions in front of St Laurence Church and the closure of the north side footway except for access. It is hoped that disruption for businesses and residents can be minimised, and pedestrian access will be maintained during working hours. Moray Council has apologised for any inconvenience caused and advised motorists and pedestrians to exercise extra care in the area while the work is underway.
Sept. 23--Calabrian police on Wednesday confiscated assets worth some 25 million euros allegedly belonging to the local mafia, including a holiday village, a luxury villa with swimming pool, agricultural land and six vehicles. Bank accounts, company shares financial assets were also impounded from the Calabrian mafia or Ndrangheta s wealthy Sia-Procopio-Tripodi clan, based in the province of Catanzaro, police said. The clan controlled various local economic activity, including tourism and drug trafficking as well as woodland clearance, according to investigators. Police investigators identified the crime gang s leadership and organisation in a 2011 probe of its deadly so-called woodland feuds with other Ndrangheta clans. Its drug trafficking, extortion and money-laundering rackets have in recent decades made the Calabrian mafia Italy s wealthiest and most powerful mafia organisation. The Ndrangheta operates throughout Italy as well as in Europe but its influence and networks extend across the world.

(M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Secretary for Food & Health Dr Ko Wing-man said the export restriction on formula milk powder could be lifted only when the supply chain is improved and adequate supply for local parents guaranteed. Dr Ko said it is not the Government s intention to permanently implement the export restriction, but that now is not the time to remove it. He said the restriction has proven effective in curbing parallel trading activities and maintaining a stable supply of powdered formula, but there is still an occasional shortage of some brands in certain districts. The Government will continue to closely monitor the situation and liaise with the trade to improve the supply chain, he added. The restriction may be lifted when the Government is fully confident that, without it, there would be no difficulties for local parents to buy powdered formula for their babies, he said.

Oxnard, CA, USA; Dallas Cowboys safety J.J. Wilcox (27) at training camp at River Ridge Fields. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports All eyes were on New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. on Sunday night as the Dallas Cowboys shifted defensive attention his way in an attempt to challenge the Giants to win another way. In the first quarter, Cowboys safety J.J. Wilcox delivered a monster hit on Beckham as he broke on a quick-in route. Later, Beckham would admit that he had never been hit that hard before. However, it was Wilcox who was left with the lasting memory of the excellent defensive play he made. After the game, he revealed that he broke his nose on the play, according to David Helman of Cowboys.com . It s probably not the best idea to question Wilcox s toughness, and it s probably an even worse idea to lead your wide receiver over the middle of the field in Wilcox s direction.

Jermaine Penannt - in Wigan colours - is sent flying by Norwich s Martin Olsson Jermaine Pennant is still a signing option for Charlton Athletic - and doesn't need to be signed before the closure of the transfer window at 6pm tonight. Because the 32-year-old is a free agent it means that the much-travelled winger can agree a deal after the cut-off this evening. Pennant continued to train with Charlton all of last week. The Addicks are still looking at potential incomings - with Norwich's Elliott Bennett one loan to be discussed - but no definite deals are on the go. Charlton want to bring in another winger to ease some of the creative and goalscoring burden that they feel is currently being placed on Johann Berg Gudmundsson.

Neha Dhupia made a sudden impact as and with Julie, back in 2004. Since then, rumour mills have been buzzing overtime about a sequel. Now, Mirror has learnt that filmmak er Deepak Shivdasani has signed, no, not Neha, but South sensation Raai Laxmi for Julie 2, a suspense thriller.

We ve been one of the biggest consumers of energy since the industrial revolution.In recent years China has surpassed the US when it comes to consuming coal and electricity, and become the world s biggest carbon emitter.But that being said, the United States still consumes more oil and natural gas than any other country in the world.In 2013, the US consumed almost twice as much oil as China, No. 2 on the list, did, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The US consumed almost 19 million barrels of oil a day that year.While we are increasingly switching to cleaner forms of energy, the US is still a powerhouse.

The article below represents a preview only and is not meant for reuse or republishing. New Delhi, Sept. 22 -- The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday told the Supreme Court that the case against former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the allocation of coal blocks to an industrial house in Odisha was that of an omission on his part and could not be equated with the corruption case faced by ex-minister of state for coal Santosh Bagrodia. The CBI made its stand clear as it rebutted Bagrodia s contention that he should be treated on par with Singh whose case has been stayed by the top court. The summoning order was stayed on the 82-year-old Congress leader s appeal and the SC admitted it. CBI counsel, senior advocate Amarendra Sharan and advcoate Amit Anand Tiwari told the special bench headed by Justice MBLokur th...
By EAST GREENWICH 〞 Allowing the underaged to drink in your home could possibly land you behind bars, a state Superior Court judge warned residents last week. The effects on the young people who drink could also last long after the buzz fades, Associate Justice Daniel Procaccini told the audience at a Swift Community Center forum addressing changes in the state s social host legislation. "About 95 percent of crime is driven by alcohol, drugs or mental illness," said Procaccini, who has adjudicated many cases involving underage defendants, most notably the Ryan Greenburg case, in which the Barrington teen was found guilty in the death of a friend following an alcohol-influenced boating accident.

10 minutes ago Heyneke Meyer (Gallo) London 每 South African coach Heyneke Meyer apologised to his country for what he said was an "unacceptable" performance by the Springboks as they lost to Japan on Saturday in the biggest upset in Rugby World Cup history. Speaking to reporters after the Pool B match at Brighton Community Stadium, Meyer said: "I have to apologise to the nation. It was just not good enough. It was unacceptable and I take full responsibility." Meyer was left to rue his team's ill-discipline in an encounter strewn with penalties. "Every time we got playing we scored tries, but our discipline was just not good enough. You can't give away soft penalties. There are no easy games in this competition." It is the second time that Meyer has apologised to South Africans in a month and a half after they were stunned in Durban at the hands of Argentina on August 8 during this year's Rugby Championship. "I'm sorry. I'm really sorry as the coach. We really wanted to make the country proud and we let them down. At the end of the day it's my job to win games and I take full responsibility for that," he said then.

Veteran Daniel Cross has opted to retire after Melbourne decided not to offer the 248-game player a new contract. The 32-year-old former Western Bulldog will play his final AFL game for the Demons against Greater Western Sydney this Sunday. Cross played 210 games for the Bulldogs across 12 seasons and another 38 matches for Melbourne in 2014-2015. Melbourne football operations manager Josh Mahoney said Cross had performed his role with aplomb since joining the Demons. "When we first spoke to Crossy, we saw his role at the club as twofold. Firstly, he could play a role on field and just as important he could play a major role off field working with our players, showing them how to prepare as an AFL footballer," Mahoney told melbournefc.com.au. "He has performed both roles extremely well over two years. His performance last weekend highlighted his character and competitiveness, where he only knows one way to play and that is by giving everything you have and never giving up. Right to the end, he wanted to keep playing." More to come
Idris Elba has laughed off James Bond author Anthony Horowitz's criticism that he is "too street" too play 007. The Luther star has long been hotly tipped to take over from Daniel Craig as the first black Bond in the spy movie franchise. Idris posted a link to the headline, saying: "Always Keep Smiling!! It takes no energy and never hurts! Learned that from the Street!!" The 60-year-old novelist, who wrote the new 007 book Trigger Mortis, has already apologised after he was quoted in the Daily Mail as saying: "It's not a colour issue ＃ Is it a question of being suave? Yeah." I m really sorry my comments about Idris Elba have caused offence [full statement attached] pic.twitter.com/UD6ouA45Uv 〞 Anthony Horowitz (@AnthonyHorowitz) September 1, 2015 Anthony said he was thinking of Idris's gritty role in the BBC crime drama Luther, and did not mean to cause offence. He said he believed another black actor, Adrian Lester, would be a better choice. Adrian Lester (Anthony Devlin/PA) Daniel Craig is expected to step down from playing 007 after the release of new movie Spectre in October. Idris is currently the second favourite to replace him, according to bookmakers William Hill, just behind favourite Damian Lewis.

(Massachusetts General Hospital) A study from members of the research team investigating whether increasing blood levels of the antioxidant urate can slow the progression of Parkinson s disease has found that the neuroprotective effects of urate extend beyond its own antioxidant properties. In their paper＃, the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators report that urate also stimulates brain cells called astrocytes to activate a major antioxidant pathway believed to have a role in several neurodegenerative disorders. A National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)-funded phase 3 trial of a urate-elevating drug, led by the senior author of the current study, will begin enrolling patients next year＃ The phase 3 trial of the nutritional supplement inosine, which is converted to urate in the body, is a follow-up to the phase 2 trial, led by Schwarzschild and colleagues at the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Rochester Medical Center. Published in 2013 and supported by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson s Research, that two-year trial confirmed that the studied dosages successfully raised urate levels in 74 recently diagnosed Parkinson s patients without producing serious side effects.

Juventus star Paul Pogba has poked fun at big-spending Manchester City after the English giants 2-1 Champions League defeat to the Italians on Tuesday. Pogba, formerly of City s local rivals Manchester United, posted a message on his Facebook page which said: "Qatar City 1-2 Juventus. Great win. Thank you for your support." Pogba may have mistaken the reference -- City s owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is actually from the ruling family of Abu Dhabi -- but the meaning of the French midfielder s post is unequivocal. Thanks to Sheik Mansour s financial clout, City are now one of the world s richest clubs.

Rangers manager Mark Warburton thinks Spurs youngster Nathan Oduwa was a worthy Man of the Match against Raith＃ Follow @insidefutbol Oduwa was in sensational form for Rangers, where he is on loan, today in a 5-0 Scottish Championship win over Raith Rovers.

ALBANY, GA (WALB) - Albany s new Broad Avenue Bridge must pass another inspection before it can open. City officials say the Department Of Transportation inspected the bridge with the Federal Highway Administration on August 31st. They sent a list of items that need to be reviewed by the contractors before it is inspected again.

"First off all of the traffic is hitting Oglethorpe and it's kind of bypassing downtown," said Yaz Johnson, Owner of Yaz Photography & Modeling Agency. "So when the Broad Avenue Bridge reopens back up everybody is going to be excited about crossing the bridge and it s going to expose more of the downtown area to those who have bypassed it along the way." The Department Of Transportation hasn t responded to multiple requests to find out when the final inspection will be conducted. City officials say it has to be completed before the bridge is handed over to the City so they can plan an opening celebration.

International coal prices, after witnessing 19% dip in past two years, have further dropped by around12% in FY15-16 and currently stands at US$52/ton compared to US$59/ton in June 2015. Slow down in demand from China and US along with rising capacities in other countries have led to the decline in coal prices. Going forward, coal prices are likely to remain weak in short term as EIA expects US demand to remain depressed. However, potential demand from South Asian countries might take prices up in longer term. Cement producers have remained the major beneficiaries of continued fall in coal prices in FY14 and FY15. Recent drop in prices is likely to bring more joys to the cement makers as it would expand margins by 2pps in FY16, experts said. They said that during the month of August 2015, cement despatches rose by 10.24 percent despite a decline of over 31 percent in exports as the domestic uptake continued to rise in view of accelerated economic activities. A spokesman of APCMA said that domestic uptake is a good sign for the industry however the decline in exports should be taken seriously by the regulators as cement with proper government interest could earn much more precious foreign exchange for the country.

The final episode of Windells' finest handicraftsmen〞Jeff Deforge, Kyle Kennedy, Kody Williams, Jake Rose, and Chris Frost to name a few〞is one frenzied mosaic of skill, speed, and slush. Even with the heat and prime lounging conditions of August dripping a lazy vibe across the Pacific Northwest, the Diggers did not in the least slow their momentum. The end of summer was hot on their heels and these unruly snow-shapers went on a mission of sideways savagery to put a satisfactory curtain-drop to the season. Ben McCabe and Ryan Finder, the inventive orchestrators behind the Diggers series , really let their imagination burst in this one. Be prepared for the apparition of multicolored craziness and avant-garde visuals throughout this blowout of ballistic boarding from the Windells

InventHelp Past News Releases RSS PITTSBURGH, PA (PRWEB) September 28, 2015 "I have three children, and when I swaddled them with traditional blankets I noticed some discomfort and safety concerns with their legs," said an inventor, from Sacramento, Calif. "In order to prevent these issues, I came up with this idea." She invented the patent-pending SAFETY SWADDLE. The very convenient SAFETY SWADDLE provides a safer alternative to traditional receiving and swaddling blankets. In doing so, it helps to prevent straightening and tightly swaddling of a baby's legs. As a result, it enhances safety and comfort when swaddling a baby and it provides a soothing effect for infants. It also maintains swaddle while transferring baby from sleeping position, to a carseat to a front pack carrier and back to bed. The invention features a secure design that is convenient and easy to use so it is ideal for use by parents of young infants. Additionally, the SAFETY SWADDLE is producible in design variations. The inventor described the invention design. "My design provides a safer, more effective way to swaddle an infant." The original design was submitted to the Sacramento office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers. For more information, write Dept. 14-SAH-806, InventHelp, 217 Ninth Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, or call (412) 288-1300 ext. 1368.

( / Bill Pugliano) Legendary investor Warren Buffett was on CNBC Tuesday morning sharing his thoughts about the presidential election. And as is The Oracle s wont, he made a joke. "The Republican race reminds me of kids playing bumper cars at an amusement park," said Buffett. He chalked up support for candidates like Donald Trump to a "lot of dissatisfaction" in the US, but said that he still watches Trump speak. "How can you not watch it?" he asked CNBC s Beck Quick. Buffett is supporting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. And for the record, he s not worried about the drama surrounding her use of a separate e-mail server during her time as Secretary of State. "It was a mistake," Buffett said. "Best thing to do is get it behind you." NOW WATCH: Warren Buffett is in the new trailer for the Entourage movie More From Business Insider

Gaborone 〞 Minister of Health, Ms Dorcas Makgato is in Dallas, Texas, United States of America for the Global Women s Initiative Summit. A press release from the ministry says Minister Makgato will make a presentation at the summit to state Botswana s position and also share the country s experience based on the recent strides that Botswana is making in prevention of cervical cancer. The release also says the USA government is a strategic partner which has through Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon a public private partnership led by George W. Bush Institute funded cervical cancer prevention programmes in Botswana. The minister will also visit United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. The US has a very functional Centre for Disease Control that has a well- integrated public health institute and emergency centre. Further, the release says Botswana is establishing a National Public Service Institute; therefore it is an opportunity to benchmark on how best the country can strengthen public health and disease control. The minister will also visit the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, US Agency for International Development and the Department of Health and Human Services. Meetings, it says, will enhance bilateral cooperation and commitment to realise the remarkable and achievable Vision 2016 and epidemic control by the end of 2017. Minister Makgato and the ministry s permanent secretary, Ms Shenaaz El-Halabi left on Saturday and are expected back home on the September 27.
NAUGATUCK 〞 A local man has been charged with having sexual contact with a minor, police said. Daniel Brundrett, of Spring Street, who turned 27 Sunday, was charged with second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor, police said Monday. He was arrested on a warrant Wednesday, when his bail was set at $200,000, they said. Court documents show his bail was reduced to $5,000 during his arraignment in Superior Court in Waterbury, which he posted. His next court date was scheduled for Sept. 23. According to police, Brundrett inappropriately touched a girl he knows. Police didn t state the girl s exact age, which would have to be below 16 to fit with the charge under state law.

Peoria Mayor Jim Ardis says he expects the city and region to absorb a sizable hit as manufacturer Caterpillar plans to reduce its workforce by as many as 10,000 people. Ardis told The Associated Press Thursday that the company has not shared specifics about the local impact of what could amount to an 8 percent reduction to its global workforce of 126,800 by 2018. Half of those cuts are expected by the end of next year. Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman said plans for a new global headquarters in Peoria "still stand" but with no firm start date in sight. The project was announced to great local fanfare in February. Ardis said he s "been assured" that the latest downsizing will have "zero impact" on the new Caterpillar headquarters.

Mamadou Barry of the Bronx and Rafael Veras of Brooklyn were both killed in their cars. Other drivers are scared and are demanding the NYPD do something.

Dr. Darrin Porcher discuss.
This pilgrim badge depicts the statue of Our Lady of Walsingham. Walsingham was one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in Europe, and over the years it was visited by several kings and queens. Pilgrimage, or the act of visiting holy places, was highly popular during Medieval times. People believed that by visiting holy shrines they would increase their chances of salvation, or being admitted to heaven after death. They might also be rewarded by having a long and wealthy life, or have illnesses cured by miracles. Lead pilgrim badges were made in large quantities from about 1350 to 1450 AD. They were brought by pilgrims as souvenirs of the different shrines they had visited and would be worn on hats and clothing. They were very fragile and, although many were made few have survived. The Lynn Museum's collection is one of the finest in the country. It was started in the late 19th century by Thomas Pung, a King's Lynn jeweller, who paid children to search for them in the mud of the Purfleet. The badges were dropped into the water by pilgrims using the ferry over the Great Ouse on their way to and from Walsingham. Many badges have been found in rivers across the country and may have been votive offerings of good luck for the pilgrimage's start and end.
A FIRE is no longer threatening homes in far north Queensland but firefighters will remain on the scene until the evening. A WATCH and act warning for the blaze, which had been threatening properties at Mount Emerald near Tolga, was downgraded at 5pm on Friday. Firefighters will continue backburning near the fire, which is still burning near Anderson Rd. Nearby residents will be affected by smoke and motorists should drive with caution. An advice message has also been issued for a fire burning at Sarina, South of Mackay. Residents there should consider taking precautionary action like wearing protective clothing, moving cars and filling containers with water. A fire that had been burning at The Caves, north of Rockhampton, has been put out.
Jonjo Shelvey has claimed that Swansea City can maintain their stunning early-season form for the rest of the campaign and qualify for the Champions League. Garry Monk s side extended their unbeaten start to the Premier League season before the international break by beating Manchester United 2-1 at home to move fourth. The win represented Monk s third successive win over Louis van Gaal, and having already drawn 2-2 away to champions Chelsea, Shelvey can see no reason why the Swans should not be dreaming big. "I feel we can compete with the big clubs now, I feel we re sort of on a par with them," the England international told Wales Online. "We can go anywhere or have any team coming here and get a result against them. "I feel that outside the top four or five, we re in that next bracket so it s up to us to prove that we can push for the top four. And I don t see any reason why this club can t play Champions League football with the manager that we ve got and the work ethic that he instils during the week. "If we keep winning our home games and keep pushing on and keep flying I think we ve got a great chance of finishing in the top four. I think this club is set-up to play in Europe. You ve seen what we did to Chelsea. You could say they only had 10 men but even with 11 I thought we gave a great account of ourselves. And we also did that against a great Manchester United side."
Sept. 15, 2015, 3:30 p.m. Andrew Veimuli in action. Adelaide man Andrew Veimuli rescued a beached Antarctic minke whale from the Port Lincoln foreshore. He said he and his family were walking along the beach this morning when they saw the whale being helped by another man, only to return about 20 minutes later to find it beached again. Mr Veimuli said it was surprising to have to rescue a whale but all he did was give it a "nudge in the right direction." Video by Brett Cooper Port Lincoln Times, SA
A Palestinian militant died when a bomb he was trying to throw at Israeli forces blew up near the West Bank city of Hebron overnight, officials from both sides said. Nathan Frandino reports. Palestinians fill the streets in the West Bank for the funeral of a man who officials say died while trying to throw a bomb at Israeli forces overnight. The incident comes amid a surge in confrontrations since Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down last year. The man - identified by an Islamic Jihad militant group as Diyaa Abdul Halim Talahmeh - had been taken to a Palestinian hospital. Officials there say he was covered in shrapnel, and that he was also shot in the head. The military said it did not shoot him. The incident came just hours before another confrontation in which the military said it shot and wounded a Palestinian woman as she tried to stab a soldier. Her condition was not immediately clear, though its impact has left Israeli-Palestinian tensions simmering once again.

President Muhammadu Buhari Wednesday in Abuja declared his administration s commitment to boosting national productivity, by among other things, taking all necessary actions to end incessant strikes by workers in vital sectors of the Nigerian economy. At a meeting with the Permanent Secretary and Directors of the Federal Ministry of Labour, President Buhari said that he was particularly disturbed by the seemingly endless strikes in Nigeria s health sector which have contributed to the fall in the standard of health services available in the country. The President directed the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Clement Illoh and Directors in the Ministry of Labour to liaise with other stakeholders and quickly work out proposals for ending the recurring strikes in the health, education, transport, oil and gas, power and other critical sectors of the national economy. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who was also present at the meeting, urged Dr. Illoh and his staff to make an input to ongoing plans for the extension of welfare services to poor and disabled persons. Dr. Illoh had earlier attributed some of the recurrent strikes in the country to the inclination of some government officials to enter into agreements with financial implications without carrying the Ministries of Finance and Labour along. He said that the Ministry of Labour has now introduced a Code of Conduct for Government Negotiators barring them from entering into agreements with financial implications without the consent of the President.

SEAT has revealed that it is going to spend 3.3 billion ($3.68 million) on equipment, facilities and R&D between 2015 and 2019 to support the launch four new models over the next two years. The announcement was made by SEAT Executive Committee President J邦rgen Stackmann during the visit to the company's facilities in Martorell by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the SEAT Technical Centre. Stackmann said that the investment is earmarked for "promoting new vehicle development R&D projects at the SEAT Technical Centre as well as equipment and facilities in the Martorell factory". The largest ever investment announced by SEAT for new models will go towards launching four new vehicles in the next two years. "These models are part of an ambitious plan to continue to strengthen the brand and boost sales, which have been growing consistently since 2013. The spending on innovation ensures competitiveness and employment, and secures the future," Stackmann said. The first of the four new models will be a compact SUV, the first ever SUV to be built by SEAT. Previewed by the 20V20 Concept, the new model will reach the dealerships during the first half of next year. The 3.3 billion investment is part of the amount announced by the Volkswagen Group last May. SEAT is the only carmaker which has the capacity to design and develop vehicles in Spain, thanks to its own Technical Centre. During the last five years, the company has spent 1.4 billion on R&D.

Squeee! Live stream from Decorah within an hour at http://www.ustream.tv/decoraheagles. The RRP Cam crew has been busy the past few days to repair/replace/install new equipment and cables to the camera shed, and carrying on Bob Anderson s visions and goals. As you will recall, Bob wanted to switch cameras to HD quality this year, and we had to contend with equipment issues and infrastructure that knocked out the live view from N1, and took out the cam also at N2 and the top of that tree. Work started today at N1, and testing of equipment is performing well. In a day or two, the team will start installing cams at N2B. It is hoped that Mom and Dad Decorah will choose the starter nest that was provided for them, and it is also our hope that in the event they choose to build their own nest nearby that the PTZ cam (point-tilt-zoom) will be able to provide a view for us ... unless they build directly behind in the blind spot where the cam would be mounted. Keep your fingers crossed that all goes well for a viewing season this year. One other bit of news from Executive Director John Howe who reports that the food treats left in the nest for Mom & Dad after the starter nest install were taken. So either Mom or Dad (or both) have been in the N2B nest.

LYNCHBURG, Virginia 〞 Josh Woodrum connected with Darrin Peterson on a pair of touchdowns as Liberty defeated Delaware State 32-13 in a season opener for both teams on Saturday night. Woodrum, who completed 19 of 32 passes for 188 yards, hooked up with Peterson on a 26-yard scoring play midway through the first quarter, and the Flames boosted the lead less than two minutes later when Desmond Rice, 139 yards, rushed for a 23-yard TD. Rice s score was set up when Delaware State s Esayah Obado was intercepted. Obado, who passed for 227 yards after missing 2014 to injury, was picked off a second time, ending a late Hornets drive at the 1-yard line. He was also tackled in the end zone for a safety. Liberty s John Lunsford boomed a 52-yard field goal. Lunsford set the school record with a 60-yarder last season. The loss spoiled the debut of coach Kenny Carter, previously an assistant at Florida, Louisville and Youngstown State. ______ http://www.collegefootball.ap.org

(WAFA) 每 Israeli police Sunday demolished five Palestinian-owned stores in the town of Hezma , just northeast of Jerusalem, according to local sources. An Israeli army force broke into the town in the morning and demolished five tinplate-surfaced stores, including a stone-cutting workshop, under the pretext of construction without a permit. The stores are located in Area C, under complete Israeli military and administrative control. The Israeli army and police have repeatedly vandalized residencies in Area C under the pretext of construction without permission. Despite filing applications and constantly trying to build houses following the legal measures, Palestinians in the West Bank, especially East Jerusalem, are rarely granted construction permits by Israeli occupation authorities. Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem are living in a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been under Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied citizenship and classified only as residents whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city. They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and remain unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel s separation wall. In 2014 alone, Israeli authorities demolished a total of 97 buildings in East Jerusalem, while demolished five others in 2015, under the pretext of building without a construction permit, reported the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian (OCHA).

Scott Camporeale will not apply for the senior coaching job at Adelaide, the club has confirmed. Fairfax Media reported on Wednesday night that Camporeale had decided to stay on at the Crows as midfield coach. Camporeale stepped into the position mid-season after the sudden death of Phil Walsh and has been praised for the job he did helping Adelaide make the finals. After the Crows season-ending loss to Hawthorn, Camporeale said the year had been "bloody hard" for everyone. He was unsure at the time whether he would like to stay in the job if asked. "I probably haven t had any time even for myself to grieve and everything with what s happened," he said. Captain Taylor Walker also praised Camporeale earlier this month. "He has brought a bit of energy along the way and I have been really pleased and excited to have been able to work with him," he said. Adelaide football director Mark Ricciuto appeared on Triple M radio on Thursday morning to say Camporeale had decided not to apply for the job, in the interests of maintaining a good work-life balance. Crows chief executive Andrew Fagan is due to give a press conference at 3.30pm on Thursday in Adelaide.

Comment ﹞ print ﹞ T T T+﹞ T- The district administration has launched a greening drive in the district and has adopted clay pot irrigation technique to conserve water. In the first phase of the programme, about 200 tree saplings would be planted along the road between Periyanagalur and Chinna Nagalur through the District Rural Development Agency, Collector A. Saravanavelraj said. The saplings would be watered through clay pot technique wherein clay pots with a small hole at the bottom would be buried adjacent to the sapling. The pots would be filled with water for percolation. The technique would help in water conservation and ensure continuous wetting for the plant. Tree guards would be installed to protect the plants from stray animals, he sai
Brede Hangeland Brede Hangeland reckons Tottenham won't be relishing the visit of Crystal Palace on Sunday. The Eagles have been superb travellers under Alan Pardew. They have won both their away games this season - at Norwich and Chelsea - to add to victories in the last campaign at Liverpool, Stoke and West Ham. Hangeland, 34, said: "Nobody will fancy playing against Palace at the moment. We have some incredible players and are a bunch that will run around until the moon comes out. "Spurs will be favourites because of their history and they are at home. We have a really tough schedule at the beginning of the season but we talked about it and said there is no reason we can't get something from any of these games. It shows the club is growing that we can go somewhere like White Hart Lane and think we can win." Hangeland deputised for the injured Damien Delaney in the 1-0 loss to Manchester City. He said: "I want to play but I'm not going to rock the boat."
Cape Town - Built out of old shipping containers, recycled wooden fruit crates and straw and clay, the upgraded cultural hub unveiled in Langa this week is itself a work of art. The new-look Guga S'thebe Theatre became a reality through partnerships and the use of recycled and local products, the City of Cape Town said. The double-storey establishment was constructed out of 11 reused shipping containers stacked in a square to form a large open area in the centre, with smaller rooms around it. Clay and straw were used for the cladding inside the containers and help to regulate the temperature in the theatre. The facade was made from old fruit crates. "The end result is a facility that encompasses local traditions and meets the needs of the community," said mayoral committee member for tourism, events and economic development, Garreth Bloor. The Guga S'thebe Theatre under construction. (City of Cape Town) "Being a labour intensive project, the employment of local residents and the skills transfer opportunities must be commended. Those who worked on the project have also received a work reference which will place them in good stead for future employment," Bloor added. The 200-seat theatre is a part of the wider Langa Cultural Precinct that intends to preserve the township's cultural history and support creative talent, the city said. The area is one of the oldest townships in Cape Town and attracts about 1 000 tourists each month. Clay and straw for the cladding inside the containers. (City of Cape Town)
New York Islanders general manager Garth Snow did not hold back when discussing the decision to return Joshua Ho-Sang to the OHL. "Enough with the bull〞-," Snow told Newsday's Arthur Staple on Saturday. "It's time to grow up." The Islanders sent Ho-Sang back to the Niagara IceDogs on Friday after the prospect slept in and showed up late to the first day of training camp. Niagara head coach and GM Marty Williamson said the 19-year-old was "devastated" and "embarrassed" about having his bid to crack the NHL roster come to an abrupt end. Williamson said the 2014 first-round pick's track record didn't give him much rope with the NHL club, and that the disciplinary measure had nothing to do with Ho-Sang's ability on the ice. Ho-Sang had been skating on a line with Islanders captain John Tavares and forward Anders Lee prior to the start of the main camp Friday.
A woman feared to have been planning to travel to Syria with her four children has been charged with child abduction, Scotland Yard said.

Zahera Tariq s hearing is set for Camberwell Green Magistrates Court She will appear at Camberwell Green Magistrates Court in London later today. The Metropolitan Police said Tariq had been charged with one count of child abduction following an investigation by the force s counter terrorism command (SO15). She was questioned by police after returning to Britain and held at Luton Airport on Thursday night. The family were believed to have flown from London City Airport to Amsterdam on August 25. All of the children - who are aged between four and 12 - were said to be safe and well when the group was detained by Turkish authorities. A private hearing was held in the Family Division of the High Court yesterday about the long-term futures of the children. Mr Justice Cobb said detail of proceedings could not be reported but he said the youngsters were together and had been taken into foster care for the "time being".

For Episode 16 of "A Waste of Time with ItsTheReal," we hit the road and headed on down to Brooklyn to visit our good friend Mac Miller at his new apartment. This episode is both hilarious and candid: we talked in great detail about his time detoxing at Rick Rubin's house, why he called Rick from Europe in the first place, and the new path he's taken in his life. Mac shared never-before-heard stories about his unreleased projects with Pharrell, Nas and Cam'ron. We discussed meeting Eminem in Japan, taking the subway around New York City, how Ab-Soul used to stay at Mac's LA house for weeks at a time, how he courted each record label when he was a free agent, that his song ended up on Travis Scott's new album, and so much more!
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said Lt. Governor Najeeb Jung is a "good man with bad political bosses" and removing him will be of no help as he is only following the orders of the Prime Minister s Office (PMO)."The Congress and the BJP both demanding Najeeb Jung s removal? Strange. Is he at fault? No. He is doing what the PMO is asking him to do," Kejriwal wrote on his Twitter-handle."Removing him will not help. His successor would also do same if the PMO kept interfering. Real solution is the PMO should stop interfering in Delhi," he said in another tweet."Najeeb Jung is a good man with bad political bosses," the chief minister said.Bharatiya Janata Party MP Udit Raj on Friday demanded Jung s removal describing him as a "super king" for not heeding the views of elected representative, a day after three of his supporters were held for allegedly assaulting an IAS officer.The Congress has also called for the removal Jung, saying he has undermined the federal basis of the constitution and was not fit to occupy the post.

We are looking forward to our first regular meeting after a few months of summer events such as a guild picnic, community demos and more. We will meet on Saturday October 3rd at 11am as usual. However, the large room we normally use will be in use by the church. The choir room is available for us and although smaller we would rather make some adjustments than try to change the meeting date. This room is smaller and there isn t room for additional items such as spinning wheels. Bring your on-going projects and any projects or news for sharing with others. Since we won t have use of the kitchen, we will not be providing drinks nor a way to heat or serve food. A bag lunch is recommended.
Wide receiver James Jones is back with the Green Bay Packers. Jones last played for the Packers in 2013, when he had 59 receptions for 817 yards. He was a free agent after that season and signed a three-year, $10 million deal with the Oakland Raiders. But the Raiders cut him after one season. The New York Giants signed Jones in July, but they released him on Saturday. On Monday, the Packers announced they signed Jones, who is entering his ninth NFL season. The Packers need help at the position after Jordy Nelson suffered a season-ending knee injury in the first preseason game. To make room for Jones, the Packers released wide receiver Myles White. The Packers also signed nine players to the practice squad: wide receiver Jared Abbrederis, linebacker Carl Bradford, running back John Crockett, cornerback Robertson Daniel, tight end Justin Perillo, defensive tackle Christian Ringo, guard Matt Rotheram, linebacker James Vaughters and tackle Jeremy Vujnovich.

CHICAGO (CBS) 〞 A northwest suburban school board has urged teachers to return to work on Thursday, after more than a week on strike. Prospect Heights School District 23's board said it made its best and final contract offer to teachers at 12:40 a.m. Wednesday, and has asked the 150 striking teachers and support staff to vote on the offer Wednesday, so students can return to class Thursday. Wednesday already had been a scheduled day off for the more than 1,500 students at the four schools in District 23. Teachers have been on strike since last Wednesday. It's unclear whether the teachers' union will take a vote on the district's latest offer. On Monday, the board offered teachers a four-year deal, with most teachers getting 3.25 percent raises in each of the first three years, and 3 percent in the fourth year. The teachers have been seeking a 3-year deal with pay raises of more than 4 percent per year.

THE UNIVERSITY OF Limerick Student's Union has launched gender-neutral toilet signage in an effort to promote gender tolerance. The bathroom signs were launched at the end of last week. "Anyone can use this restroom regardless of gender identity or expression" reads the sign, beneath symbols indicating men, women, the disabled, and a combination of the normal men and women symbols to indicate transgender. "With the passing of the Gender Recognition bill we wanted to make a talking point around the university," Union Welfare Officer Ciara Corcoran told TheJournal.ie.

West Ham have been fined 50,000 and warned over their future conduct following the behaviour of their players after midfielder Mark Noble s dismissal at Liverpool last month. Noble, who scored the second goal in his side s 3-0 Barclays Premier League victory at Anfield on August 29, was sent off in the 78th minute when referee Kevin Friend judged him to have fouled Danny Ings. West Ham have been punished for their players reaction to Mark Noble s red card at Anfield That decision was overturned on September 2, after Noble had insisted his challenge was not even worthy of a yellow card and manager Slaven Bilic was equally critical. However, the Football Association charged the London club over the reaction of Noble s team-mates following Friend s decision and a statement from the governing body on Friday evening read: "Following an independent regulatory commission hearing, West Ham United have been fined 50,000 and warned as to their future conduct after an FA player misconduct charge brought against the club was found proven. "It was alleged that in or around the 78th minute of the game against Liverpool on 29 August 2015, West Ham failed to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion. "The club had admitted the charge and submitted a plea for mitigation." Noble will be available for the Hammers game against Newcastle at Upton Park on Monday, when the Hammers could also welcome three of their deadline-day signings - Victor Moses, Michail Antonio and Nikica Jelavic - into their squad.

Houses in the up-market Belfield Abbey development, completed to builder's finish several years ago by O'Flynn Construction are due to come to market in the new year. Size: 136 sq m (1,464 sq ft) Bathrooms: 3 Bedrooms: 3 BER: B3 A number have been sold quietly in the past several years, but this offer, the slick No 46, is a privately-owned resale. The three-storey end-terrace home is fresh to market this week with agent Timothy Sullivan, who guides at 375,000 for this walk-in job, in a very well-kept estate. It's within an easy walk of Cork City centre, on a bus route serving Mahon's City Gate office developments, and there's schools and services in the adjoining suburbs. It's been privately occupied for five or six years and is going to suit a mix of traders up, the better-heeled starters out, and some traders down too, reckons Mr Sullivan. As a design/layout feature, these houses have an open plan 26' by 18' ground floor living/dining/kitchen, a first-floor living room, next to a master en suite bedroom, with two further top floor bedrooms, and bathroom. Recent sales of similar Belfield houses nearby in recent years have ranged from mid 200,000s to 310,000, with uncompleted fit-outs and interiors, the mid terraced No 47 sold in 2013 for 268,000. No 1, larger and detached on the main Boreenmanna Road, sold by Christmas in 2013 for 500,000. VERDICT : Great location, well-finished. Irish Examiner Ltd. All rights reserved
On the first Sunday of October we'll celebrate Homecoming at High Peak Baptist Church. That's an important week in our church's calendar since that's the day we look back at where God's taken us with a view of looking forward to where He may take us. I'm starting a new series leading up to our Homecoming celebration, since I finished our series through the book of 1 Corinthians. I'm calling the series Home Going: A Peak Behind the Doors of Heaven. It's all about what's heaven really like. The series kicks off this week with a look back at Revelation, a passage many of our Sunday School classes studied recently. Read Rev. 14 to take a look at the passage. Does that look boring? Think about this: what do you expect heaven to be like? Have you ever heard people say they thought heaven would seem boring? Clouds with harps all day?

Puppynap put my reigns on. I sat down. I m used to it, if Daddy isn t here we don t leave the house for at least 10 minutes after I ve gotten ready. it s all his checking! Today we re going down the road. To have a little sniff of the flowers. Leap the odd curb or two. See some magic leaves dancing in the sky. Remember to wait until it s all clear by the big road. Have another sniff of some flowers, and a drink out of the stream. Before going back to Tudor times. And running half way home because it starts to pour with rain. David was bothered to hear my tale of my walk, he was even more tired than me and I ve been busy today.

There's great buzz right now around the reopening of Clifton s Cafeteria in downtown LA, but what do we really know about Clifford Clinton, the man who created it all and was considered one of the most powerful〞and controversial〞men of 1930s Los Angeles? He looked like a chemistry professor and talked like a man of God. He made certain his establishments followed the Golden Rule. He offered a "Pay What You Wish" policy and believed the profits he earned from the restaurants could help feed the needy. For them, he created the Penny Cafeteria, a downstairs meal room where the hungry could buy meals for pennies. He opened the first Clifton s Cafeteria in 1931 at 618 S. Olive St. with $2000 in his pocket and 2,500 recipe cards. Soon, he had created a franchise catering to weary souls during the Depression, a haven for the rest of the city and a place to speak one s mind. He also made enemies〞most notably the chief of police, the district attorney and the mayor. When he saw corruption, he went after it. Plus, his vision for what he hoped Los Angeles would become could very well read like a treatise about Los Angeles in 2015. Guest: Edmond Clinton III , eldest grandson of Clifton's founder, Clifford Clinton, and author of Clifton s and Clifford Clinton: A Cafeteria and a Crusader; he grew up working at Clifton's Cafeteria as a teenager and has been an internist on staff at Huntington Memorial Hospital since 1978

The 70-year-old Oscar- and Tony-winning actress has officially declared her days of baring all for the camera over. In an interview with Alan Cumming for CBS, Mirren said that there s a benefit of aging. "You don t have to do that sort of thing anymore...[Now] my pleasure pillows are purely for my husband." She previously appeared nude in 1979 s Caligula and more recently in a 2011 photo shoot for New York Magazine . Photos: Viola Davis, Ellen Pompeo and your favorite TGIT stars hit the red carpet Mirren said that she remembers not thinking much of appearing nude when she first began her career. "It was the era," she said. "It seemed to be nothing to get your knickers in a twist over." Though, as she notes, it doesn t seem to mean much today either. "Now, with Game of Thrones ," she said, "[nudity is] on at eight o clock at night and everything s a sex scene."

TORONTO - Some municipal politicians opposed to the Ontario government s plans to sell Hydro One say the issue is hurting federal Liberals on the campaign trail. More than one third of Ontario s municipalities have passed resolutions opposing the Liberals plans to sell 60 per cent of Hydro One, with many complaining they were not consulted. Sarnia Mayor Mike Bradley says federal Liberal candidates knocking on doors for the Oct. 19 election are hearing about the planned sale, "and not in a good way." Bradley says provincial Liberals consulted municipalities on everything from pit bulls to clothes lines, but never gave them a voice on the privatization of a public asset that turns over a dividend to taxpayers every year. He rejects Liberal claims they campaigned on "asset sales" in last year s Ontario election, saying you d have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out that meant selling Hydro One. Katrina Miller of the Keep Hydro Public coalition says voters are wondering if Wynne would act in such a unilateral way, would Justin Trudeau act in a similar manner?

A group of Arsenal supporters have called on their fellow fans to boycott the Costa Coffee chain after Diego Costa s antics led to Gabriel Paulista getting sent off at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Costa was confronted by Gabriel during the Blues 2-0 victory over the Gunners after the Chelsea striker whacked Laurent Koscielny in the face with a swinging arm. Gabriel was eventually sent off for kicking out at Costa, who in turn was given a caution by referee Mike Dean. With numerous Arsenal supporters feeling angered by the decision, Twitter fan account Our Lot in Block 5 has urged everyone to avoid Costa Coffee until Gabriel serves his suspension.

: Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin has expressed his disappointment over the action of Malaysian football supporters who threw flares on the pitch during the match with Saudi Arabia here tonight. Malaysia's fourth 2018 World Cup and 2019 Asian Cup qualifying match was stopped in the 88th minute with Saudi Arabia leading 2-1. Khairy tweeted to say that he saw the incident which humiliated Malaysia. "I was at the Shah Alam Stadium tonight. Saw for myself the shameful incident. Throwing flares is wrong. Stadium control failed. "FAM (Football Association of Malaysia) lost control at their own stadium. Fans throwing flares is wrong. Both at fault tonight." The match was stopped for 30 minutes while awaiting a decision by the championship secretariat. Malaysian fan Abdul Aziz Jaafar, 45, said he was disappointed with such wild actions of fans which caused the match to be stopped. He said the people in charge of security at stadiums, including FAM, should be more sensitive on such matters. "The situation is dangerous as firing flares and firecrackers may hit other spectators and the players. "This is can endanger the safety of those not involved. What is even more disappointing is that security personnel on duty failed to keep the situation from getting out of hand," he said. 〞 Bernama Comments comments

Islamabad: Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif responding to the Indian army chief's statements earlier this week, said that Pakistan is ready for a small scale or prolonged war if Indian leadership proceeded with the same, Radio Pakistan reported. Asif said that Pakistan is a firm believer of peace in the region and world at large, but was fully prepared to respond 'befittingly' if provoked. "Our forces crushed the Indian dreams of occupying Lahore back in 1965 and will do the same in future," the defence minister said. He said that Pakistani forces have been fighting a war against terror on their own soil and are ready to deal with any external enemy, if the need arises. Asif claimed that the country's political leadership 岸 including the prime minister 岸 would not hesitate to offer any sacrifice for the defence of Pakistan if the two countries were to lock horns. Indian Army Chief Gen Dalbir Singh on Tuesday had said that India is prepared to face offensive military action on its borders should the need arise, and that any future conflict was expected to be short and swift. Indian newspaper The Hindu had quoted him as referring to the ceasefire violations along the borders in Jammu and Kashmir, which have put relations between India and Pakistan under strain.
Orlando Pirates coach Eric Tinkler is working on restoring his team s confidence for their "once in a lifetime" clash with Al-Ahly on the weekend. READ: Tinkler rues poor decisions Pirates will host the Egyptian giants in the first leg of a CAF Confederation Cup semi-final at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. And Tinkler concedes his team s morale took strain with the 4-1 defeat to Zamalek in their Group B decider 10 days ago. The Sea Robbers have since drawn 1-1 with Mpumalanga Black Aces and 0-0 with Polokwane City in the League. READ: Papic content with Bucs point "The areas we want to improve obviously are defensively, and I'm happy we kept a clean-sheet 每 that is something we can take away from this game," Tinkler said after the stalemate with City on Tuesday night. "It's a good morale-booster for the goalkeeper, and obviously for the back-four as well. "Our offensive play, we've kind of gone off the boil. There has been a knock in our confidence after the game against Zamalek, but what's important now is just trying to motivate these boys and to make them understand it's a massive game on the weekend; it's almost a once in a lifetime opportunity, and we need to make the most of it," concluded the former Bafana Bafana midfielder.
Bugatti has released another teaser photo of its upcoming Vision Gran Turismo Concept. Although the concept will only be available to drive in the Gran Turismo video game series, the styling should mimic what we will see when the successor to the Veyron, likely called the Chiron, is eventually unveiled. In this photo, we see the hub of one of the car's wheels which features a central locking system resembling special edition Veyron wheels. Based off the multitude of teasers released by Bugatti, its Vision GT concept is going to be an extreme looking race-bred machine. The Frankfurt Motor Show will play host to the Vision GT Concept, while next year's Geneva Motor Show will likely host the debut of the Chiron, a hybrid hypercar that is said to cost over $2 million and pack about 1,40
Schools in Sudbury are getting ready to welcome back students while preparing to minimize the chance of a run-in with bears after a recent number of grisly encounters in the area. Norm Blaseg, director of education with the Rainbow District School Board, told CBC News he will be relying on staff to keep an eye out for the safety of students. For the sake of caution, Blaseg said if there is any risk from a bear outdoors, school staff members will immediately call students inside. Blaseg said his custodial staff will play a critically important role in minimizing the risk of a student meeting a bear by keeping food waste that attracts animals out of plain sight. "Whether it is garbage, or whether it is bags or whether there are any disposal sites that we hold our garbage in, [we must ensure] that they are securely locked," he said. "If it is bags, they make sure that they are brought into the building and make sure that they are secure so the bears don t have anything to access." As CBC News has previously reported, Sudbury police have received more than 1,200 calls about bears roaming around local neighbourhoods. That figure is twice as many as authorities received last year. The increase in complaints has led to more police encounters with bears. Several bears have been shot by officers in the past few weeks. The most recent incident was on Monday when a sow was shot and her two cubs were relocated to a sanctuary near Parry Sound, Ont.

Donald Trump will meet with Republican Party chairman Reince Priebus Thursday in New York City, one day after party officials began circulating a loyalty pledge that looked squarely aimed at the Republican front-runner. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed the meeting to CNN. Trump also announced that he will have a 2 p.m. news conference at Trump Towers Thursday. The Republican National Committee had quietly circulated a loyalty pledge to the Republican presidential candidates, requesting they affirm their allegiance to the party. The pledge was likely aimed at pressuring Trump, who has so far refused to rule out a third-party bid if he does not win the Republican nomination. The pledge, a copy of which was obtained by CNN Wednesday, states "I, _______, affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for President of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee, regardless of who it is." It continues: "I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek to accept the nomination for president of any other party." The Trump campaign and the RNC declined comment Wednesday. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar writes anti-Trump op-ed Martin O Malley attacks Ben Carson s plan to shut VA
Los Angeles (AFP) - Jen Welter, who blazed a trail for women as a coaching intern with the NFL s Arizona Cardinals, confirmed Friday she s accepted Floyd Mayweather s invitation to his fight against Andre Berto. "Yes the rumors are true," Welter tweeted after TMZ reported Mayweather s invitation. "Looking forward to seeing money in action. Thanks FloydMayweather and MayweatherPromo." Unbeaten Mayweather is looking to take his record to 49-0 on September 12 in Las Vegas, in what he vows will be his last fight. But Welter s acceptance of the invite drew some criticism because of Mayweather s history of domestic violence. "So you would prefer I prejudge from a distance?" she responded on Twitter. "I consider the invitation from FloydMayweather a positive step." Welter, a former rugby and professional gridiron player who owns graduate degrees in psychology, became the first woman to hold a coaching position of any kind in the NFL when the Cardinals hired her to work with inside linebackers during training camp and the pre-season. As her internship was winding down, Welter suggested in an interview with Yahoo s Katie Couric that having women coaches in the NFL could help address the problem of domestic violence by NFL players. "You have an opportunity to make them better men, and not just better football players, and ultimately that is the goal," she said.

Google/ US Patent Office Google s patent designs for a potential head-mounted display. Since Google Glass transitioned earlier this year from experimental Google X moonshot to viable idea, we haven't heard much from the newly-formed department. The Explorer program was shut down when Nest alum Tony Fadell took over the project, and in the intervening months, no designs have leaked. Google/ US Patent Office Google s quaint diagram of jogging w＃ However, a Google patent published last week details structural elements that could be key to future generations of Google Glass. The patent mainly concerns a component that varies in tightness to keep snug hold on the user s head. The component, a piezoelectric material(that is, a type of material that gathers an electrical charge through mechanical forces), is located in the side-arms of the eyewear, and may be activated based on how much the user is moving. (I write "may" because the word is used exactly 450 times in the document.) The patent describes a situation wherein a user is jogging. The eyewear would be able to calculate running speed based on an accelerometer and gyroscope, and could tighten or loosen itself if necessary, or even physically move the display to give the user a better angle. Movement data could also come from a separate wearable device. However, the component wouldn t need any tiny plastic cogs or other moving parts to do all this, because the piezoelectric material is just intelligently flexing to reposition itself to give the user the best view. In essence, Google is designing glasses tha＃
De Gea row rumbles on Real Madrid President Florentino Perez was quick to point the finger of blame at Manchester United after the collapse of the David De Gea transfer - and now the Old Trafford club have answered his snipes. De Gea s move to Real Madrid fell through in the final minutes of the Spanish transfer window last Monday, as the necessary paperwork was not filed in time for the transfer to be completed. Perez stated earlier on Friday that it was United were showed "inexperience" and behaved "disgracefully" in their handling of the De Gea transfer and now the Old Trafford club have offered this repost. "The facts speak for themselves. The FA are prepared to back our case that documents were in on time," a Manchester United spokesman said, "We all like to blame others but if you let one slip through your fingers into the back of the net, then ultimately the culpability is yours." It was a firm and determined clarification from United, who will not have been amused by the suggestion that they are amateurs when it comes to finalising big money transfers. However, there are still question marks over United s transfer dealings in a summer when they tried and failed to sign a host of big name stars such as Gareth Bale, Sergio Ramos and Thomas Muller.

This was during their show 'The Extra-Time' aired on SuperSport channel.

"This was most shocking and distressing to receive on a Saturday morning 每 a time when people all over the country and outside were looking forward to enjoy the national ceremony," said Shongwe. He said he could only imagine the shock and distress the families were going through at this sad time. "My condolences go to those affected at this very distressing time."

Days after the first Tasmanian devils immunised against a deadly facial cancer were released into the wild, two were killed on the roads. Disease didn t kill them, but cars did. Days after the first Tasmanian devils immunised against a deadly facial cancer were released into the wild, two were killed on the roads. The animals, with microchips, were released only last Friday. They were found dead on roads bordering Narawntapu National Park in northern Tasmania on Monday and Tuesday. "Sadly, we were able to confirm the devils as two of the 20 released into Narawntapu on Friday night," Save the Tasmanian Devil program manager David Pemberton said. "To lose two devils so soon after their release into the wild is devastating," he said. It is the first attempt to repopulate devils in the wild after widespread losses because of devil facial tumour disease. The captive-bred animals were among the first to be immunised against the cancer. Despite the road deaths, the trial remained on track to providing valuable information on the effectiveness of the vaccine, a government statement said. Devils often scavenged roadkill carrion, and their dark fur made them hard to see at night, Dr Pemberton said. "The deaths highlight that roadkill is an ongoing threat to the endangered Tasmanian devil," he said. Park patrols have been increased to remove roadkill that might lure devils onto the roads to feed, and feed stations have been set up away from roads. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

It was the moment that had neutrals celebrating as fervently as Namibia s players and coaching staff as yet another minnow made their mark. It was the moment that had neutrals celebrating as fervently as Namibia s players and coaching staff as yet another minnow made their mark at this year s Rugby World Cup. Namibia s Johan Deysel prompted London s Olympic Stadium to erupt in a frenzy when he crashed over for a stunning try against New Zealand in the 51st minute on Thursday night (Friday morning AEST). The surge from the stands first arrived the moment Namibia entered the All Blacks territory and grew with expectation and hope as the spread the ball wide to their outside backs. There was little in the way of an overlap as New Zealand s defence looked to have Namibia covered, that was until a quick burst of pace from the 23-year-old centre caught them napping. When the ball got to Deysel, the 23-year-old sprinted through two defenders with a quick turn before spinning past another to score his country s only try in their 51-14 loss to the world champions. To make the moment even more special for the youngster, it occurred a day before his birthday. smh.com.au

Talks on a new deal for England boss Roy Hodgson will be delayed until after Euro 2016 to avoid the "unsavoury position" that emerged with Fabio Capello after the 2010 World Cup, FA chief executive Martin Glenn has stated. Glenn insisted Hogdson was "comfortable" with the decision to wait until after the tournament before talking about a new deal - his current contract expires after Euro 2016. Capello was given an extended deal just weeks before the 2010 World Cup began - a tournament which then became a major disappointment for England and the FA found themselves saddled with the Italian. Share article Glenn, speaking at the Soccerex conference in Manchester, said: "Roy is very comfortable with the situation. What we wanted to avoid was the slightly unsavoury position we had with Fabio Capello at the end of the World Cup where it clearly didn t work." England have not dropped a point in the qualifying competition and in July Hodgson questioned whether it was correct for the FA to delay a decision on his future until after Euro 2016 because it could generate speculation and uncertainty in the build-up to the tournament.

A Georgia high school violated a local public school district's policy by allowing a mass baptism of members of its football team on the school's field, in an event criticized by a group advocating for the separation of church and state, officials said. A pastor dunked 18 Villa Rica players and a coach into a tub of water on the school's field in a baptism ceremony before an August team practice. Carroll County schools assistant superintendent Terry Jones said in a statement on Monday that the baptisms violated school district policy and that the district did not know the ceremony was scheduled to be held at the high school. "We are pleased that the school district has publicly affirmed its commitment to keep religion out of public school events, and concurs that the bizarre baptisms crossed the line," Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the advocacy group Freedom From Religion Foundation, said in a statement on Tuesday. The group noted that a coach had invited Pastor Kevin Williams of First Baptist Church of Villa Rica to perform the mass baptism.

(CNN) - 62 million girls. That s the number of girls around the world who are not in school. On Saturday, first lady Michelle Obama announced a new campaign during the star-studded Global Citizen Festival in New York s Central Park to raise awareness of the issue. "I see myself in these girls. I see my daughters in these girls. These girls are our girls, and I simply can t walk away from them. So for me, this is truly a moral issue," she said in a videotaped message played during the event. It s also an economic issue and a health issue, she said In the video appearance, Obama asked supporters to post photos of themselves on Twitter and Instagram along with a message about what they learned in school using 62milliongirls. The photos will be posted on 62milliongirls.com to highlight the number of girls who aren t receiving an education. The social campaign, in partnership with Girl Rising, is part of the Let Girls Learn initiative that the first lady and the President announced in March. There was a pause in the taped message to allow people in the audience to start posting with the new hashtag, which Obama herself had already used. Later in the evening, she appeared at the festival in person with Beyonc谷 Knowles. Celebrities and supporters added the hashtag with their own tweets about education.
Barclays and HSBC are among seven banks being investigated by Swiss officials amid allegations of price fixing in the precious metals market. The Swiss Competition Commission (COMCO) said it was looking at whether the banks had concluded "illegal competition agreements" when trading precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium. The Swiss Competition Commission is looking at whether the banks had concluded "illegal competition agreements" when trading precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium It added: "COMCO has opened an investigation against two Swiss banks, UBS and Julius Baer, as well as against the foreign financial institutions Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Mitsui." The investigation is expected to be completed by 2017. Both Barclays and HSBC have already been fined in recent months for unrelated offences. Barclays was hit with a massive 1.5 billion fine in May for rigging foreign exchange rates, while HSBC was ordered to pay 28 million in June over failures relating to alleged money laundering at its private Swiss bank. Share prices in both banks were down slightly in early trading. Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.

If I had a choice between living forever as an adult or child, which would I choose? That's a tough one, if I lived forever as a child I'd be running from farmers with pitchforks saying I'm the devil. So, I think I'd rather live forever as an adult instead. At least that way I could just say I eat my greens and do yoga every morning, Yeah. I'll choose to live forever as I'm now, thankee!! How about you :)

The Mercedes-Benz Concept IAA will make its debut at the 2015 IAA 每 that's industry speak for the Frankfurt motor show 每 but the vehicle appears to be a clever play on words, with an embedded caption in the image stating IAA stands for Intelligent Aerodynamic Automobile . The concept model is expected to be teased over the coming days ahead of its reveal at the Frankfurt show , and very little is currently known about the mystery car. We've split the single teaser image into two more digestible pictures to give you an idea of what it could be. Indeed, Mercedes-Benz has only hinted that the car will feature "next level design", and given the name Intelligent Aerodynamic Automobile, it seems clear this will be a vehicle with sleek lines 每 as the above image, presumably of the rear windscreen and D-pillar, suggests. Could it be another genre-melting concept car? Could it be a high-tech replacement for a current model? We'll find out soon. Stay tuned for more on the Mercedes-Benz Concept IAA in the coming days.
Legal & General Investment Management has launched a new best ideas credit fund which aims to provide growth and sustainable cash flows at relatively low risk. The L&G Multi-Strategy Credit Fund is a Luxembourg-domiciled SICAV fund which hopes to produce a positive total return over a three-to-five year period. The fund looks to generate returns through an active allocation to core return-seeking assets, such as high yield and emerging market debt. This is with tactical allocations made across credit, rates and currency markets to provide a diversified source of risk adjusted returns. Management of the fund will fall to Omar Saeed, who is currently senior macro credit fund manager at LGIM and also runs the Legal & General Dynamic Bond fund. Saeed joined LGIM in February from Zurich-based Swisscanto Asset Management. Commenting on the new launch LGIM's co-head of global fixed income, Anton Eser, said: 'Multi-strategy credit is an unconstrained investment approach and is designed to capture our best ideas across global fixed income markets, with a strong emphasis on downside risk.' 'This style meets the evolving needs of our pension fund clients as their fixed income allocations increasingly require a more flexible, benchmark agnostic approach.'

Earlier this week - because Farrah s insanity isn t limited to violent fantasies - she informed her castmates that she s more popular than Kim Kardashian . As you can tell, the woman has raised the facepalm bar pretty high, but if you were afraid that she would run out of ways to make you shake your head in disgust, worry not: The producers of Celebrity Big Brother wanted someone to represent America and because Donald Trump is busy running for president and Charles Manson is in prison, they went with Farrah Abraham and various other psychos like Tila Tequila.

The closing of the 67th Annual Emmy Awards brought Hollywood to their feet when actor/comedian Tracy Morgan took the stage as a surprise guest. It was back in 2014 when Morgan was severely injured in an auto accident when a Wal-Mart semi truck slammed into the actor s limousine on the New Jersey Turnpike. The accident left comedian James "Jimmy Mack" dead and Morgan in a coma for two weeks with head trauma and a broken leg and ribs. The Emmy appearance was Morgan s first real public appearance since the accident. On stage he showed a serious and emotional side people aren t used to seeing and told the audience how much he missed them. He also thanked his "amazing doctors," family and wide for all their support over the past 15 months. Although serious, we did see the Tracy Morgan we know when he joked, "I feel like myself again, which means a whole lot of women gonna get pregnant at the after-party." Backstage after the show Morgan posed for some shots with his wide and 2-year-old daughter (pictured above). We re so glad Tracy is doing better!

The Ashanti Regional Police Commander, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCOP) Mr Nathan Kofi Boakye, has asked the public to desist from associating the service with political colours. He said the men and women of the service were apolitical and worked according to the laws of the land and anyone found to have fallen foul of the law was dealt with accordingly. According to him, the Ghana Police Service was not affiliated to any political party so any policeman who identified himself with a political party was not fit to wear the uniform. Mr Boakye, who was speaking at the inauguration of a police station at Asawase in the Asokore/Mampong municipality last Monday, also warned the public to stop attacking police stations to free suspected criminals. Self-defence According to the regional commander, if anyone took the law into his or her hands, the police would go by the law and ensure that the person was dealt with. "The Ghana Police Service does not discriminate; irrespective of your ethnicity, when you fall foul of the law, you will be dealt with according to the law. Professionalism Mr Boakye further advised the personnel to be professional in the discharge of their duties and not to use their uniform to intimidate the public. He commended the Municipal Chief Executive of Asokore Mampong, Mr Nurudeen Hamidan, for supporting the police. The police station project was a collaboration between the Member of Parliament for Asawase, Alhaji Muntaka Murabak and the municipal assembly.
4chan founder Christopher "moot" Poole has sold the controversial message board to Hiroyuki Nishimura, creator of the Japanese anime forum 2channel. Poole, who handed off daily site duties to a team of moderators early this year, declined to reveal terms of the acquisition. In an interview with The New York Times , Poole said Nishimura is literally the only person in the world with as much 每 if not more 每 experience in running an anonymous, large destination community that serves tens of millions of people. He's the great-grandfather of all of this, Poole praised. In a statement on the matter, Nishimura said he is proud to be taking Poole's place as the owner of 4chan, adding that he has long admired the site's place on the web as a producer of anonymous and Internet culture. The new owner added that he looks forward to continuing to grow and develop the site and support the community. The exact direction that Nishimura will steer 4chan in, however, wasn't disclosed. If you haven't already surmised by this point, the similarity in names and the fact that 2channel's founder was the one who bought 4chan wasn't exactly a coincidence. Poole created 4chan in 2003 at the young age of 15 as an American version of 2channel where people could discuss anime. The site has expanded significantly since its creation and while it does still have an anime section, the /b/ section is home of the type of content the site is most known for.

OTTAWA - The country s annual inflation rate held steady as expected in August as lower gasoline prices moderated the higher cost of other items such as food, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday. Annual inflation was 1.3 % last month, the same as in July, and matching economists forecasts. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items and is closely watched by the Bank of Canada, was less muted at an annual pace of 2.1%, though that was down from 2.4% the previous month. The Bank of Canada has cut interest rates twice this year to try to bolster an economy that was in mild recession in the first half of 2015. The bank sees the effects of a weaker currency and some sector-specific factors as temporarily boosting the core rate. Prices were up on an annual basis in seven of the eight major components of the overall consumer price index. Food saw the biggest increase, with prices up 3.6% compared to August of last year. Meat prices jumped 6.3%. But gasoline prices continued to drop and were down 12.6% annually. The transportation component, which includes gasoline, was the only main segment to decline.

The recent shocking incident of a mother losing her baby at the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital is an appalling indictment of our public health system. Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu must bear a lot of the blame. Her initial term of office in the health portfolio was mired in controversy and she was replaced by Hope Popo, who seemed to be making progress. His frank willingness to admit departmental deficiencies and interact with his DA counterpart Jack Bloom probably led to his demise and Mahlangu inexplicably made a return to a post she seemed wholly unqualified to hold. Clearly she can t resuscitate the ailing hospital system. Her comments subsequent to the incident reflect her abject failure to grasp the seriousness of the crisis. ＃

A majority of voters are ready to vote for Britain to leave the European Union, according to a shock opinion poll. The Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday found that if a referendum was held tomorrow 51% would vote to quit the EU against 49% who would vote to remain. The findings run counter to a string of recent polls which have consistently shown comfortable majorities in favour of staying in. As recently as July, a Survation poll gave the "in" camp a 54% to 46% advantage. Politicians will be wary of reading too much into one survey - particularly given the closeness of the margin. Nevertheless it is likely to set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street ahead of David Cameron s promised referendum - which must take place before the end of 2017. It will also provide a huge fillip for the "out" campaign ahead of a possible Commons rebellion by Eurosceptic Tories when MPs return to Westminster following the summer break on Monday. Share article The poll suggested that the margin in favour of leaving could grow if the migrant crisis continues - with 22% of those who said they would vote to stay indicating they could change their minds if the situation worsened. The poll, of 1,004 people, was carried out by Survation between September 3 and 4.

By Brendan O'Brien, Italy captain Sergio Parisse is expected to train with the squad tomorrow ahead of the Azzurri's Pool D game against Ireland this Sunday. Word earlier had suggested that the captain, recovering from a haemotoma in his calf which prompted him to miss the France and Canada games, would not return to the paddock until tomorrow at the earliest. However, team doctor Vincenzo Ieracitano said the skipper, who has not trained in three weeks and who joined the squad from France yesterday, would train before undergoing a fitness test in the gym later in the day and again on Friday before the team is named. Italy's team doctor said: "Tomorrow he will definitely train with the rest of the squad, then on Thursday he will go through a fitness test in the gym. "And if that goes well we will see how he gets on in training and then we will have another check to see if he can play." Vice-captain Leonardo Ghrialdini, who suffered a slight pull to his right hip flexor against Canada, has undergone cryotherapy treatment and will be examined again today. Ieracitano said he is "not likely" to feature against Ireland.
Canberra golfer Matthew Millar says the "kick up the backside" of being forced to win back his tour card is behind his hot form after taking a share of second at the New Caledonia Open. Canberra golfer Matthew Millar says the "kick up the backside" of being forced to win back his tour card is behind his hot form after taking a share of second at the New Caledonia Open. Millar shot a six-under 65 in the first round on Wednesday to sit one shot behind Victorian Daniel Valente. The Gold Creek professional has registered five top 10 finishes in six starts this year, including his maiden Australasian Tour victory at the New Zealand PGA. Millar kept his playing rights by negotiating qualifying school, and isn t taking his second chance for granted. "I guess I had a couple of light bulb moments over the time off and having to go to Q-School was a good kick up the backside," he said. "I have just come out and believed more in the way I play and not worried about the way other people play. "I putted really well. I had been putting pretty ordinary the last few weeks which isn t usually my thing. "This is a golf course where you need to putt well and I certainly bounced back well." The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
NEW ORLEANS 每 Ten years after Hurricane Katrina struck and shuttered the doors of the historic Orpheum Theater, the venue is set to reopen. The Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra returns Thursday to what had been its home base for 14 years before the venue closed after the 2005 storm. Orchestra President John Reeks, who is also one of its clarinetists, says Giuseppe Verdi's "Requiem," a piece reflecting a funeral, was the last one played by the orchestra before Katrina. Turns out, it was an unplanned requiem for the building. When they found out they'd finally be returning, Reeks said there was no question as to what piece would be performed 〞 Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 2, "Resurrection." The theatre has undergone a $13 million restoration over the last 22 months.
While Deadpool has long been affiliated with the X-Men universe, only one familiar mutant has been confirmed to appear in Tim Miller's new movie 每 Piotr Rasputin, aka Colossus. However, according to Deadpool creator, Rob Liefield he isn't just there to make up numbers＃ "You are going to love Colossus," said Liefeld at Amazing Hawaii Comic Con. "He's in it 每 I hope Fox doesn't get mad at me 每 he's in it a good amount. He doesn't just walk through the movie." This will be welcome news to Colossus fans, who have seen him make minor appearances in the X-Men franchise without really leaving his mark. That said, original actor Daniel Cudmore will not be reprising his role, with the metal-skinned mutant now being played by actor/stuntman, Andre Tricoteux. He will join co-stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein and T.J. Miller when Deadpool hits our screens in the UK on February 5 2016 and the US on February 12 2016.
LOS ANGELES 〞 A blind football player has officially joined the team at Southern California. USC freshman Jake Olson is a long-snapper attending school on a special athletic scholarship for physically challenged athletes, but eligibility issues prevented him from officially practising with the sixth-ranked Trojans until Tuesday. Olson was the long-snapper on field goal attempts for his high school team in Orange, California. He gets help from teammates to line up, but takes care of the rest himself. He has been around the Trojans since Pete Carroll was the coach in 2009, the same year Olson completely lost his sight. Coach Steve Sarkisian says he would love to see Olson play in a game for the Trojans someday, although it isn t imminent.

FREETOWN, Sept. 28 -- Sierra Leone on Sunday began another 42-day Ebola countdown after the last two Ebola patients were discharged from the Mathene Treatment Center in the northern city of Makeni, local officials said. According to the local district Ebola response officials who declined to be named, "all people that were in quarantine homes in the Kambia and Bombali Districts have ended their 21 day incubation period and have been released".

The Journal of Pain Research has published the original research "". As corresponding author Mr Christopher Malone says "Migraine headache is a painful chronic condition affecting millions of people in the United States. In our study, we endeavoured to better understand how migraine headaches impact the lives of migraineurs. We asked migraineurs about a variety of experiences such as the treatments they have tried, aspects of their medical and psychiatric history, and how migraines have impacted their life." Mr Malone continues "Our findings suggest that stress associated with migraine headaches must be understood as a multidimensional experience with broad impacts on an individual s social and personal life. This stress may also contribute to the development of other medical and psychological comorbidities leading to a cyclical negative relationship wherein stress is both a cause and effect of migraine headaches." As Dr. Michael E Schatman, Editor-in-Chief, explains "This study is noteworthy in that it provides readers with a unique perspective on quality of life issues associated with migraines - which have been largely underreported up to this point." The Journal of Pain Research is an international, peer-reviewed, open access, online journal that welcomes laboratory and clinical findings in the fields of pain research and the prevention and management of pain. Dove Medical Press Ltd is a privately held company specializing in the publication of Open Access peer-reviewed journals across the broad spectrum of science, technology and especially medicine.

"Engineers will find solutions to their day-to-day challenges. Non-engineers will gain an appreciation for the challenges and difficulties of making software." While some of the content is technical in nature, much of it is described in a non-technical way. Perhaps for the first time, the importance of technical practices in enterprise software development is discussed in a way that non-developers can understand. This makes valuable to a wide range of readers who are associated with the software industry including executives, managers, and staff members as well as customers and students. Beyond Legacy Code: Nine Practices to Extend the Life (and Value) of Your Software is an insider s view of a software industry in crisis, losing billions of dollars a year on broken software development processes.

X Factor judge Rita Ora was reduced to tears in the third episode of the show, when she had to cast the deciding vote. The 24-year-old singer, one of the latest additions to the judging panel of the ITV singing competition, had to cast her vote as to whether to send 24-year-old dental nurse Shianne Phillips through to the bootcamp stages or end her journey on the show.

Angel in the custom-made enclosure... Ready for your close-up? Felty. ndpreservation: Unchain my heart! Er＃book. This book once belonged to a chained library, until it was released from the bonds of literary servitude to grace our vault. Now it has a lovely home in a custom enclosure! Made by a former student, the custom enclosure houses the book and its chain safely, leaving room at the top of the box for a recess in which the chain fits snugly. The top tray of the box has an extending piece that performs the double function of forming the top wall for the book and keeping the chain from bouncing about when the box is closed. 
The BMW i8 stands out with its futuristic lines, sporty interior and a highly advanced drivetrain. While its design is near perfection, there are always subtle things that can improve its looks, one of them is a new pair of custom wheels. HRE Performance Wheels, one of the best in the wheels business, have applied their experience in the motorsport, racing applications and street cars to create a wheel line for the BMW i8. The wheels installed on the hybrid sportscar are the HRE RS103 line . Featuring a multispoke, the custom wheels add a classy look to the sportiness of the i8's design, thanks to its black spokes matched with the silver color of the wheel. The BMW i8 uses a plug-in hybrid system consisting of a turbocharged three-cylinder BMW TwinPower Turbo petrol engine and BMW eDrive technology in the form of an electric drive system. The 1.5-liter combustion engine develops 170 kW/231 hp and drives the rear wheels of the BMW i8, while the 96 kW/131 hp electric drive sends its power to the front wheels and allows an all-electric range of up to 35 kilometers (22 miles) and a top speed of 120 km/h (75 mph). The powertrain allows the BMW i8 to sprint from 0-62mph (0-100km/h) in in 4.8 seconds and has an electronically limited top speed of 260 km/h (160 mph). The full photoshoot of this BMW i8 build done by Wheels Boutique can be found in the media gallery below. The article Photoshoot: A BMW i8 Equipped With HRE RS103 Wheels appeared first on BMW BLOG

I go every six months to my dentist for a cleaning and check up because I want healthy teeth. My dentist is Kiyo. His office is in MinamiUrawa in front of he station. We met at the Rinri Houjinkai long, long ago. He and his wife were my students for several years. He is a great guy and a great dentist. He is very thorough. That means that he works until the job is completely done. That also means that he "leaves nothing to chance". All his equipment is high-tech. All his staff use microscopes when necessary while working on patients teeth or gums or whatever they work on. I went Tuesday. It was my last free day from the Kindergartens. (I started back today). My wife and youngest daughter are also in his care (are his patients). He did some especially good work on Eri s teeth. This time my cleaning went smoothly except for one tooth that had some plaque. She worked hard to remove it. And then Kiyo fixed one tooth that had a chip on the top. I am all set for another six months. Brushing, cleaning and flossing for a happy smile!
After ThursdayaEUR(TM)s trading in PepsiCo Inc (http://www.marketintelligencecenter.com/symbol/PEP"PEP) MarketIntelligenceCenter.com s patented algorithms uncovered a trade that offers a 7.88% return or 21.62% on an annualized basis (for comparison purposes only), while providing 1.90% downside protection. The trade is a Jan. 16 covered call at the $97.50 level for a net debit of about $90.38. The net debit is also the breakeven point for this trade. For a higher return, consider buying a longer-term call option, like the Jan. 17 at the $82.50 level. By buying the call for $13.35 instead of paying about $92.13 for the stock, the assigned return rate for this alternate trade is 29.31%, but the stock has to finish above $94.10 when the sold call expires for this trade to be profitable. Standard & PooraEUR(TM)s has a 3 STARS (out of 5) hold ranking on PepsiCo. Technical indicators for the stock have been bearish and support and resistance have been in the area of $91.38 and $93.12, respectively.
REMEMBER how dazzlingly bright Venus was in the evening sky a couple of months ago? The Evening Star has now become the Morning Star as it shines in the east before dawn, rising a couple of hours before the Sun. If you have a pair of binoculars they will show you the planet as a tiny, silvery crescent. Just to the left of Venus, but a lot fainter, lies Mars. It really does have a distinctive orange-red colour to the naked eye, and binoculars bring out the ruddy hue even more. The Sun remains very active, so any clear night, keep an eye on the northern sky for a surprise display of the northern lights. Look for a red or purple tinge to the sky around and beneath the stars of the Big Dipper. Share article Stuart Atkinson Eddington Astronomical Society of Kendal.
12:42 a.m. EDT By Larry Fine NEW YORK (Reuters) - Roger Federer cut down big-serving American John Isner in straight sets at the U.S. Open on Monday to claim an accustomed grand slam quarter-finals spot at Flushing Meadows. The Swiss second seed, winner of a record 17 grand slam titles, beat 13th seed Isner 7-6(0) 7-6(6) 7-5 to set up a last eight clash against 12th-seeded Frenchman Richard Gasquet, who ousted sixth-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych in four sets. The world number two will be contesting his 46th grand slam quarter-final. Federer, who never lost his serve, held his own from the service line to thwart Isner and used his returning skills to derail a pair of long streaks enjoyed by the American. The 34-year-old Federer closed out the two hour, 39 minute fourth-round match by breaking the six-foot-10-inch (2.08 meters) Isner s serve, ending the American s string of 108 consecutive service holds at the U.S. Open, dating back to the beginning of last year s championship. His perfect scoreline in the opening set tiebreak snapped an even longer Isner streak. In 429 tiebreakers played by Isner, he had never dropped one 7-0. "Seven-love obviously is a pretty good score against John," said Federer. (Reporting by Larry Fine; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly)

I was able to make my small survey about this game in the playschool among 20 children (age 4-6 years) and in the school class among 22 children (age 9-11 years).I brought 5 different table games but with the same theme, they split into groups for 4-5 persons, played every game about 30min. After conducting a survey the results were really impressed. The question was which two of five games you d like for yourself? My game chosen:The first group (4-6 years) -65 %The second group (9-11 years) - 80 % The numbers are average, as children s responses differed according to gender. Of course, this game more liked boys, Also would like to say that adults who have played this game have recognized it as a sufficiently interesting as well and would like to buy it for their children.

Soda fans successful in bringing pop back By Updated 09/08 2015 09:01AM Copyright 2015 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Surge soda has returned to some store shelves, a year after Coke brought back the 1990s drink through Internet sales. There is still a loyal base of hard-core fans for the citrus-flavored soda with a kick. When Coke brought it back via Amazon in 2014, fans bought out supply available on the first day, despite a price of $14 for a 12-pack of 16-oz cans. A Surge Web site currently shows it for sale in the Midwest, South, upper Great Plains states, as well as some eastern states. There s also a map of independent resellers nationwide, though mostly collectors stores rather than grocers. Coca-Cola did not respond to requests for comment. Surge had its heyday in the 1990 s, but Coke discontinued it at the start of this century. Fans of the soda started The Surge Movement, seeking to convince Coke to bring it back. It s page on Facebook has attracted more than 200,000 "likes." In 2013, the group raised $4,000 to a buy a billboard near Coca-Cola s Atlanta headquarters that read: "Dear Coke, we couldn t buy Surge, so we bought this billboard instead."
Speed bumps are widely regarded as a pain, so it may come as no surprise that, according to researchers from Oxford University, they can be used to diagnose acute appendicitis. The British scientists who made the discovery have been recognised in this year s Ig Nobel awards, presented for achievements that make people "laugh, then think". Dr Helen Ashdown, from Oxford University, and her team showed that a yelp of pain as a patient was being driven over speed bumps was indicative of acute appendicitis. The speed bump test picked up 97% of people with the condition, but was less good at avoiding "false positive" identification of those who were free of the complaint. Writing in the British Medical Journal, the researchers concluded: "Presence of pain while travelling over speed bumps was associated with an increased likelihood of acute appendicitis. "As a diagnostic variable, it compared favourably with other features commonly used in clinical assessment .. "Speed bumps may have a useful alternative benefit in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis." The Ig Nobel awards, from the spoof scientific journal Annals of Improbable Research, were presented at a ceremony at Harvard University in the US last night. They are intended to parody the Nobel prizes due to be announced next month. Other Ig Nobels were awarded for studies fitting chickens with prosthetic "dinosaur tails", looking at the plausibility of a Moroccan emperor fathering 888 children, and discovering the most painful bee sting points on the body.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday announced a toughening of the penalties for stone throwers following a third day of clashes in and around Jerusalem s flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound, AFP reported. Young Palestinian demonstrators threw stones at Israeli police who had entered the compound in large numbers and responded with stun grenades in fresh clashes Tuesday despite international calls for calm. Netanyahu s announcement at the start of an emergency meeting of ministers and security officials came after the death of an Israeli driver who lost control of his car after apparently being hit by stones in Jerusalem on Sunday. 2015 All rights reserved.

Lupita Nyong o doesn t know where to raise her children. The 12 Years a Slave actress - who has been single since splitting from rapper K naan last year - has fond memories of her childhood in Kenya, but also loves her life in New York . Asked whether she d prefer to raise her family in America or Africa, she said: "This is my conundrum. When I was back in Kenya this past week, I would be driving along with my mother and she would say, That s a nice school for children and look at me like..." However, the 32-year-old star won t worry about making that decision until she finds the person she wants to have children with. She added in an interview with America s Vogue magazine: "But I think that will all be determined when I have that moment. When I have that man." For the time being, Lupita is content with her low-key life in Brooklyn. She said: "I live alone there. I lie quite low. I take the subway. I do yoga. I meditate." However, she will always feel "a child of Kenya". She added: "I definitely feel there s a lot of America in me. "The idea that you can be self-made is very vibrant in America. You can do anything that you want to do. That spirit pushes you on. But it took me leaving Kenya to really appreciate the glory of the place. Ultimately, I will always be a child of Kenya."

Boko Haram members NIAMEY, Niger (AA) 每 A raid by Boko Haram on a village near the Nigerian border left 15 civilians dead, a security source and local media reported late Friday. The attack on N'Gourtoi, which lies across the Yobe river from Nigeria's Borno state around 30 kilometers (18 miles) from regional capital Diffa, was launched Thursday night during the Muslim feast of Eid al-Adha. "Boko Haram killed fifteen people, including a village leader, for agreeing to work with the military," a local security source said on condition of anonymity. Hassan Ardo, an official with the Diffa governor's office, told the state-run Tele Sahel broadcaster the attackers had burned down 22 houses and a mill and wounded four other people. The region has suffered several deadly attacks by Boko Haram, a militant group linked to al-Qaeda, since February. In July, 38 civilians, including 10 children, were massacred in villages near Diffa. Niger is part of a military coalition with Chad, Benin, Cameroon and Nigeria to combat Boko Haram, which has waged a war against Nigeria that has killed at least 15,000 and left 2 million homeless since 2009. 2015, Newstime Africa.

Geneva police have announced the arrest of the "most-wanted bank robber in Canada" 〞 known for a technique of jumping over bank counters in his heists. The French-American citizen, nicknamed "The Vaulter Bandit" but not identified by name, had been sought under an international arrest warrant issued by Canada in connection with 22 bank robberies over the last five years. A Canadian banking association had offered a 100,000 Canadian dollar ($75,000) reward for information leading to his arrest. Police spokesman Jean-Philippe Brandt said Wednesday that the 53-year-old suspect was intercepted by plainclothes police while he was driving a compact car on a Geneva street on Tuesday, and taken into custody without incident. He is being held pending extradition procedures. Police said he could face life in prison if convicted.

Source: Verge, The Coverage Type: analysis Location: The Verge, New York, NY, United States [Commentary] So let s talk about ad blocking. You might think the conversation about ad blocking is about the user experience of news, but what we re really talking about is money and power in Silicon Valley. And titanic battles between large companies with lots of money and power tend to have a lot of collateral damage. The Apple vs. Google fight has never been more heated or more tense, and Facebook s opportunity to present itself as the savior of media has never been bigger -- through hey-it s-just-about-speed Instant Articles, which will almost certainly be featured higher in the News Feed, and huge things like its massive video initiative, which is a direct assault on YouTube. And oh -- Apple s new tvOS, that huge bet on bringing apps to TV? Doesn t support WebKit at all. So it s Apple vs Google vs Facebook, all with their own revenue platforms. Google has the web, Facebook has its app, and Apple has the iPhone. This is the newest and biggest war in tech going today. And the collateral damage of that war -- of Apple going after Google s revenue platform -- is going to include the web, and in particular any small publisher on the web that can t invest in proprietary platform distribution, native advertising, and the type of media wining-and-dining it takes to secure favorable distribution deals on proprietary platforms. It is going to be a bloodbath of independent media.
DAMASCUS, September 15. /TASS/. Political forces in Syria should consolidate around popular demands of security and stability for all, Syrian President Bashar Assad said in an interview with the Russian mass media. "We, Syria's political forces, both inside the government and those off power, must get consolidated around demands of the Syrian people," Assad said. "If you ask any Syrian what he or she wants today, they will not hesitate a minute: security and stability for each and all." "We must continue dialogue to reach a consensus," he stressed. "But if we want real success, it is impossible as long as people are dying, as long as blood is being shed and as long as people cannot feel safe. We will reach nothing unless we rebuff terrorism in Syria." He said consolidated society in Syria was impossible unless it embraced various peoples living in the country. "The Kurds are part of Syrian society, they are not alien, they have been living in this land along with Arabs, Circassians, Armenians and many other nationalities and religions co-existing in Syria from time immemorial," Assad said. "No integral society is possible in Syria without these constituent parts." {{item.group_date}} 妤抉抗忘戒忘找抆 快投快
The Jets and kicker Nick Folk have restructured his contract according to Field Yates. Source: the Jets have converted $1.78M of K Nick Folk s $2.5M base salary into a signing bonus, creating $1,186,667 in cap space for 2015. 〞 Field Yates (@FieldYates) September 12, 2015 What does that mean? Well, for starters it does give the Jets an extra $1.1 million in immediate cap space to work with. It also adds $593,333 to his cap hit over the final two years of his contract in 2016 and 2017. The $1.78 million that was part of his salary this season is now spread evenly over the last three years of his deal ($593,333 in 2015, 2016, and 2017). It will now also count against the Jets cap even if they cut him as dead money. For Folk s part, he isn t taking a pay cut. He would have gotten that $1.78 million paid evenly over the course of the season. Because the deal was restructured, the Jets are going to cut him a $1.78 million check now. That s not a bad deal. This is minor shuffling of resources, creating a little more today and taking a little from tomorrow.

Six people died and more than 300 have been left injured in the last year as a result of gas-related incidents. The figures were revealed by the Gas Safe Register, which said it found dangerous appliances in one in six of the 142,507 homes it had inspected over the past five years. People are being warned of the dangers of unsafe appliances as part of Gas Safety Week, which runs until Sunday, September 20. Across the UK, the West Midlands had the highest number of homes with unsafe gas appliances, where one in four inspected were found to be unsafe, compared with the East Midlands, which had the fewest number of homes with unsafe gas appliances, equivalent to one in nine. Share article Jonathan Samuel, chief executive of Gas Safe Register, said: "With the average cost of safety checking your gas boiler at just 60, it s a small price to pay to keep you and your family safe and prevent damage to your home. "While we re seeing more people getting gas safety checks compared to last year, millions are still taking risks so we re reminding people to make sure all their gas appliances are safety checked every year."
Vicki Michelle is pressing charges against Farrah Abraham after she was glassed on Celebrity Big Brother s Bit On The Side . The Allo Allo actress has confirmed she will be taking action against the former Teen Mom star, who allegedly smashed a glass over her head during a heated argument with Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace on the live panel show following her eviction from the reality show house earlier this week. Her agent Paul Person told ITV News: Actress Vicki Michelle MBE is this morning with Hertfordshire police and will be pressing charges against Farrah Abraham, who struck the back of her head with a glass during the recording of CBBBOTS this week. Vicki has been in show business for 40 years and has been left in deep shock and with concussion after the attack by Ms. Abraham. The 64-year-old star - who appeared on I m A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! last year - and Farrah Abraham are both helping the police with their investigation. A spokesperson for Hertfordshire police told MailOnline: Officers are continuing to make inquiries with relevant parties following the incident which occurred at Elstree Studios on the evening on September 22. These investigations are on-going at this time. No arrests have been made.

South London rapper and producer Conrad Kira prides himself on being an outsider. A denizen of abandoned industrial buildings, where he creates massive sub-bass-driven beats that mirror the dystopian decay of the city, he combines harsh, bracing arrangements and biting, poetic social commentary. And indeed, his new EP Rictus has a similar effect of American masters Run the Jewels, a fresh new voice on the UK hip hop landscape. Influenced not only by London pirate radio but Kraftwerk and Tupac, Kira thrives on musical diversity. "I've always been the Black Sheep," he says. "I'm not part of any 'scene'. I'm wearing a baseball cap one day and a cloak the next. Get me to DJ at a party and you'll hear Wiley back to back with Enya I can't help it." Rictus is out now.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A car bomb exploded close to the presidential palace in Somalia s capital Mogadishu on Monday, police said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility from the Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which is trying to overthrow President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud s Western-backed government. The group stepped up attacks this month, retaking a town in the central region and attacking African Union troops. "A suicide car bomb exploded outside the compound of the presidential palace. There were casualties but we are still investigating," Ali Hussein, a police officer, told Reuters. Ahmed Aden, a resident in the area, said he had heard a loud blast followed by gunfire. "Now we see huge smoke coming from the scene. Soldiers surrounded the area and we can only see ambulances rushing in and out," Aden said. Mohamed Abdullahi, another police officer, told Reuters the attack may have been aimed at palace guards who sit in the area.

Embattled German carmaker Volkswagen has enlisted the law firm that defended oil giant BP following the calamitous 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. A Volkswagen spokesperson on Wednesday said Kirkland & Ellis are "a retained firm". The firm represented BP after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster, which killed 11 men and saw millions of barrels of oil flow into Gulf waters in one of the worst environmental calamities in United States history. In July, BP announced an $US18.7 billion ($A26.72 billion) settlement to compensate the US and five states for damages from the spill. Volkswagen faces a tangle of lawsuits and regulatory investigations following its admission that it intentionally sought to circumvent US pollution rules. The carmaker developed technology, known as a "defeat device," to allow its diesel cars to meet pollution limits during official testing but which turns off when the car is driven on the road, allowing the spewing of health-damaging emissions. On Wednesday, Volkswagen chief executive Martin Winterkorn resigned in the wake of the scandal, saying he was "shocked by the events of the past few days".
After months of training, both girls had their first meets last Saturday at completely different places nowhere near each other. Bill went to Katy s meet and I went to Emmy s. Katy is running varsity! (At least for the first two meets. Varsity is determined each week based on your finish time.) There are four freshman on the varsity team! My co-worker took this at the meet. High school meets are a 5K. The varsity team finished second out of seven teams! Emmy is running for the middle school team. She ran her two-mile course in 16:44 which is awesome! (She enjoys the "team" aspect of the team more than the running.) Look at that form on Emmy! Aurora s middle school s boys and girls teams both finished first out of 15 teams!

Created: 09/21/2015 12:22 PM WHEC.com By: By BERNARD CONDON NEW YORK (AP) 〞 U.S. stocks are higher in midday trading as investors try to look beyond the uncertain timing of a possible interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 107 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,494 as of noon Eastern time on Monday. The Standard & Poor s 500 index rose 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,968 and the Nasdaq composite gained 13 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,840. Stocks are rebounding from sharp falls on Friday. Those declines were caused by concerns that the Fed s decision to keep interest rates at record lows signaled a weak outlook for global growth. Chipmaker Atmel jumped after it accepted a bid from Britain s Dialog Semiconductor. The price of U.S. benchmark crude rose 3.1 percent. Bond prices fell, pushing up the yield on the 10-year benchmark Treasury note to 2.19 percent from 2.13 percent on Friday. (
Manager Chris Hughton is likely to stick with most of the team that defeated Hull as Brighton try to extend their lead at the top of the Sky Bet Championship by beating Rotherham. Bobby Zamora made his first home appearance for Brighton since 2003 as a substitute but he is again expected to be on the bench, particularly with starting strikers Sam Baldock and Tomer Hemed, who scored the only goal against Hull, continuing to impress. "The two of them were able to work together a lot during (pre-season) and I m pleased for both as I knew that I wanted to go with two up front," Hughton said. The manager again has a fully-fit squad to choose from. Rotherham captain Lee Frecklington is unlikely to be fit. The midfielder limped out of Saturday s 1-1 draw at Charlton with a calf injury and the problem will be assessed in the build-up to kick-off. The Millers stayed in the south after that game at The Valley in a bid to stay fresh and a squad of 22 travelled, meaning boss Steve Evans has plenty of options at his disposal. Defender Kirk Broadfoot is not one of them, though, as he serves the ninth game of his 10-game ban.

I feel horrified that there s only around 50 days left in 7/8T. It feels weird that two years ago I was being greeted by a grinning Mr. Tait, telling us how the classroom functioned, and describing the day ahead. Three booklets later, and here you have me. The holiday problem would be strange, and I think the break is necessary, but it would be really nice to have a extra two weeks at the end of the year. The WNBs this year have been great. I had a really hard time picking my favourites, and that s saying something. Poor Mr. Tait had to judge those every week. I m pretty sure everyone here is proud of their WNB. Maths this year has been fantastic. Mr. B is a really good teacher, and has helped tremendously with my learning. He s also hilarious, especially when he gets worked up over problems. Next term will be a gem. The year sevens won t know what hit them. It ll be great...

A PARTY from Settle s Holy Ascension Church attended The Big Sing at the Albert Hall where two special episodes of Songs of Praise were recorded over a four-hour session. The outing was organised by one of the church members and the group included parish priest Hilary Young, two retired clergy, two church wardens and the church treasurer. Mrs Young said: "You probably won t see any of our faces on the broadcasts as we were so high up in the hall, but it was an amazing experience to have insight into the making of the programmes and a great privilege to be part of them."

The local football league at the centre of an outcry over sledging has brought in new rules to stamp out anti-social behaviour. The local football league at the centre of an outcry over sledging has brought in new rules to stamp out anti-social behaviour. On Wednesday last week, the South Metro Junior Football League wrote to its members announcing new rules aimed at banning sledging. Last week The Sunday Age reported a complaint by one woman whose 12-year-old son was the subject of a sledge ending with the words, "when I f..ked your mother". Anthea Conroy s son and his friends said such taunts were not unusual in junior footy. Ms Conroy welcomed the new rules, saying she had wanted the league to send a clear message to young boys that talking about women this way was never acceptable. Psychologists and adolescent health experts said taunts such as this one and the recent example by tennis player Nick Kyrgios had a big impact on young kids who were developing their identity, including how to relate to the opposite sex. The league wrote: "The SMJFL Board would like to comment on the article that appeared in The Sunday Age. Sledging a player in a derogatory manner at no stage is acceptable ... In order to demonstrate the league s commitment to eradicate anti-social behaviour and sledging on the field, in 2016 the league will go one step further and implement a new unsociable sledging bylaw". The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

Valencia head coach Nuno has refused to criticise his players after they lost 3-2 to Group H rivals Zenit St Petersburg at the Mestalla. It was a disastrous start to Valencia s Champions League campaign as they fought back from two goals behind before Axel Witsel s strike condemned them to defeat. However, Nuno believes that his side were unfortunate to walk away from the game without a point on a night when Zenit s clinical edge made the difference. "There was one team that wanted to go for the game, and that was us. From the first minute to the last," the Valencia boss told reporters. "We always prepare players for all aspects of the opposition. We knew the danger posed by Hulk; we made a mistake allowing him to shoot, but I value what we tried to do more. "We were the better team, dominating the match, and we controlled things. We will work on individual aspects because what we want is to grow and improve." Valencia return to action against Real Betis on Saturday.

It's been a while since I've shared some family friendly music, and with the school holidays coming up, now is a great time to fill up your iPod! Joining us today is our music reviewer Jill, who describes herself as "a mother of two awesome children, a facepainter, a community services worker, who wants to be a domestic goddess when I grow up (probably more goddess, less domestic)＃" 每 take it away Jill! Rocksteady by Josh & the Jamtones Right from the start, this album had us bopping along. Starting strong with 'Race U', Josh & the Jamtones blend reggae, ska, rap, alt rock, and a little funk into an infectious list of songs; throwing in some humour between tracks for good measure. Our other top picks include 'Love' and the uncredited bonus track. It's certainly clear that Josh & the Jamtones love what they do, and their exuberance truly shines through. This upbeat album will have your kids dancing and singing along, yet it's sophisticated enough that will keep you rocking out in your car even after school drop off. I would recommend this to any family looking to move away from/avoid traditional 'kids music'. And, like a picture of a penguin, it would be impossible to listen to this and remain down in the dumps!

Management at the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience in Co Clare have warned of the dangers of rock and mud slides following last weekend s severe weather. The Cliffs of Moher Coast Walk was pounded by torrential rain last weekend leaving sections of the popular track flooded and in a dangerous condition. There have been four incidents in the past week where walkers sustained injuries requiring hospitalisation. One person had to be airlifted to hospital. Many of the recent incidents happened at locations where walkers strayed from the official cliff trail to get close to the cliff edge to take photographs. While rockfalls are not uncommon in the area, last weekend's severe weather conditions have resulted in more frequent incidents prompting management at the cliffs to issue an urgent warning. Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience Director Katherine Webster said: "Following the recent storms the Cliffs Coastal Trail is in a very dangerous condition." "There have been multiple mudslides and rockfalls and there are many sections of cliff edge that are unstable and may fall at any time. We are appealing to visitors not to walk the trail at the moment as it is not safe," she added. There have been several dramatic rockfalls at the cliffs this year. The Doolin unit of the Irish Coast Guard has also responded to as many as a dozen incidents in the past year where people had been injured in falls along the 20km trail.

Munch on cashews, berries and chocolate to counter the ill-effects of an unhealthy lifestyle, says an expert. Suvro Ghosh, founder of online healthcare portal Helpmedoc, suggests a list of stress-busting food items: * Avocados: Avocado is loaded with nutrients including vitamin E, vitamin B and potassium. By controlling hunger and regulating the sugar levels in the blood, avocado helps in reducing stress immensely. * Cashews: They are rich in zinc and the substance has a major role to play in tackling depression and anxiety. * Berries: Berries are a good source of vitamin C that is a great stress-buster in itself. * Chocolate: It imparts a feel-good-factor and reduces stress as well. * Green tea: It also helps in improving mental performance and activating the brain cells. * Banana: Bananas are rich in potassium that is a natural source of vital mineral, which helps to normalize the heartbeat, sends oxygen to the brain and regulates your body's water balance. When we are stressed, our metabolic rate rises, thereby reducing our potassium levels. These can be rebalanced with the help of a high-potassium banana snack. * Walnuts: Having walnuts helps one to combat stress and stay calmer and happier even on a hectic day.

The other day I was picking up a "deposit" that my dog made while out walking. I said to the person I was with: "Of all the senses that could be enhanced, I would pick smell the last." She proceeded to tell me about someone she knows who has no sense of smell. The woman has spent her lifetime working in maintenance doing jobs that can have offensive odors to some. She has also served on many trips as a missionary, going to places that can be olfactory-challenging to tolerate. In short, she has capitalized on her reality and turned something that could be considered a limitation into an advantage. Can you smell a lesson in all of this? Try to sniff out another perspective on something to turn a downside into an upside instead of turning your nose on the problem. -- beth triplett leadershipdotsblogspot.com @leadershipdots
Ukrainian nationalists destroyed a tent city erected by Hasidic Jews in Uman, ahead of the annual Rosh Hashanah pilgrimage. "On Shabbat, when they knew we wouldn't be able to respond or activate the communication device, they simply knocked down the fence, pushed the light poles and security cameras and caused damage estimated at half a million dollars," Eliezer Kirshboim, chairman and director of the Jewish association in Uman, told the Israeli daily Yediot Acharonot. "We are approaching the High Holidays, and this disrupts all our work arrangements." Police officers did not intervene to stop the attacks, the newspaper reported, citing witnesses. Since the fall of communism, Uman has seen the arrival of thousands of pilgrims on the Jewish New Year who come to visit the grave site of the Breslover movement's founder, Rabbi Nachman. The pilgrimage has created frequent friction between the predominantly Israeli new arrivals and locals, many of whom resent the cordoning off by police of neighborhoods for the pilgrims. Kirshboim said the current mayor of Uman was "appointed" by members of the nationalist Svoboda party following the revolution in Ukraine. "There is crazy state of anarchy here," he said. The right-wing activists were seeking to harass the Hasids in order to gain political points among the local public, Kirshboim asserted. "Whoever harasses the Hasidim more has a better chance of winning the elections in October," he said.
A local council has set up an energy company in a bid to tackle the "big six" firms.

The company will use energy generated from the city s incinerator, solar panels and waste food plants and also buy in gas and electricity from the market. Alan Clark, Nottingham City Council s portfolio holder for energy and sustainability, said: "The UK s domestic energy market has been hit with fluctuating Government policies and subsidy cutbacks. "In recent years, the cost of utility bills has spiralled as the profit-hungry big six energy companies have exploited their monopoly. "We have decided to take the bold step of setting up Robin Hood Energy so that energy can be provided to customers across Nottingham and beyond at the lowest possible price, run not for profit, but for people."

WASHINGTON: New York City faces an increased risk of flooding, similar to what occurred during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, as global warming causes more frequent storms and sea levels to rise, scientists said.

Billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg may have just purchased a townhouse in the West Village. According to The Observer, the three-story brick townhouse〞located at 157 West 12th Street〞was bought anonymously under an LLC, However, the name on the deed is one Tom van Loben Sels, a partner at the Palo Alto-based tax-consulting firm Apercen Partners LLC. Van Loben Sels has assisted Zuckerberg with his insane money in the past. But as The Observer notes, it s possible that he assists other Silicon Valley guys with their insane money. The townhouse (which wasn t even on the market) previously sold in 2004 for $3.4 million, but as we all know, $3.4 million isn t cool. You know what s cool? $22.3 million (which is how much the buyer reportedly paid for the property). ﹞ Mark Zuckerberg Appears to Be the Buyer of 157 West 12th Street [NYO] ﹞ Has Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg snagged a $22M Manhattan townhouse?

Erin Brockovich The USEPA is dumping a cancer-causing chemical into Valatie Kill Creek in New York, a tributary of the Hudson River. Nice job guys! Same lame excuse used in Animas River spill in Colorado caused by the USEPA... the creek is not a drinking water source... it only has fish in it. According to the USEPA, the solvent 1,4 dioxane is a carcinogen; however, for months the agency has been releasing the solvent into the Valatie Kill creek from the Dewey Loeffel Superfund site in upstate New York. http://www2.epa.gov/＃/ffrro_factsheet_contaminant_14-dioxan＃ The Times Union reports that "[t]he Valatie Kill is not used for drinking water, but it is a protected trout stream that flows into Kinderhook Lake in Columbia County, and which then drains into Kinderhook Creek, a tributary of the Hudson River." The Times Union also reported that in June 2015 dioxane levels in the creek had increased ten-fold since February. In July the USEPA said that dioxane levels had decreased after a filter was replaced, but according to the chart below, the discharge of dioxane has increased dramatically since the end of July. http://www.timesunion.com/＃/Nassau-supervisor-raises-alarm-＃
California lawmakers have advanced a pair of bills to keep drones away from schools and jails. The state Assembly on Thursday approved legislation by Republican Sen. Ted Gaines of Rocklin on two unanimous votes. SB271 would make it make it an infraction to intentionally fly drones above public schools during school hours. It would apply to unmanned aircraft flying up to 350 feet, but makes exceptions for law enforcement, news media and people with written permission from the school. SB170 would make it a misdemeanor for a person to intentionally fly a drone over a state prison or a jail, which is a way to smuggle drugs or other contraband in. The bill provides exemptions for jail and prison employees. Both bills head to the Senate for a final vote.

The Justice Department is cracking down on white-collar crime by giving federal prosecutors new tools to bust corporate crooks. The department said Wednesday that companies would be required to turn over evidence against individuals if they want credit for cooperation. The policies were detailed in a memo written by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who will detail the changes in an NYU Law School speech Thursday. "Americans should never believe, even incorrectly, that one's criminal activity will go unpunished simply because it was committed on behalf of a corporation," Yates said. The Justice Department has secured multi billion-dollar civil settlements against several banks in recent years, but it's been criticized for not being tougher on Wall Street executives after the financial collapse.

I am super tired tonight, with a bunch of things left to accomplish before bed. I am planning on being in bed (and hopefully asleep) by 11 pm. Today was a pretty good day. I think I should have gotten some activity points while watching the Packer game...my heart rate was elevated for the entire game. They won, which means my staff will talk to me tomorrow, The game was just too close for comfort. After the game, I did my normal weekly chores...my kids keep asking why we have to clean all the time...I keep telling them "so things stay clean." I think they are too little to understand the concept. After they went to bed, I got all of my steps in, did the dinner dishes and now will be packing for my trip this week. I am within my daily points today, which was nice, and have a decent plan for eating while I am away. I am hopeful my hotel has a treadmill so I can be certain to get all of my steps in while I m gone, but if they don t I will be buying day passes for the fitness center in town. I think this is the most "in control" I have felt at the end of the weekend. Usually on Sundays I am scared for the week ahead because I have burned a bunch of flex points...I have plenty of flex for the week,..and I m feeling great (even though I could fall asleep standing up)
10:00 09 September 2015 Mymms finished second in the SHCL Premier Division table, so play third placed Harpenden on Saturday for a place in the following weekend's final, which will be played at Home Farm. Against Sawbridgeworth, Mymms lost the toss and were asked to bat first. They were 220 all out from 43.5 overs. Bamford's contribution was vital following the early losses of Herts captain Nesan Jeyaratnam (8), James Southgate (0) and Syed Kazmi (3). This left Mymms on 20-3, however Bamford and Hamza Qayyum dug in and helped get the score back on track. Qayyum was eventually bowled by Dharmarajsinh Jhala for 24 from 64 balls with the score 109-4. Skipper Andy Lewis made just two before he was bowled by Matt Billings, however, alongside Bamford, Scott Hadley (17), Rhys Wynne (14) and Prithviraj Sarvaiya (16) saw their side to 220. In reply, Sawbridgeworth were all out for 161 in 39.5 overs as their challenge faded. Mymms' Kazmi starred with the ball taking 4-20, while Southgate and Sarvaiya both took two wickets. Wynne and Arslan Shahid took the other scalps. The visitors' George Kenny top scored for them with 43, while Harry Jerome chipped in with 25 and Jhala made 16.

Josh Duggar is seeking treatment at Reformers Unanimous in Rockford, Illinois, a source confirms to ET. The facility offers faith-based treatment and is the same place the Duggar family has lauded in the past. "We love the Duggar family," Tony Richardson, Director of Development at Reformers Unanimous told ET on Friday, though he declined then to confirm Duggar was a patient. "Our hearts and prayers are with them." Richardson says the center has an "over 80 percent success rate," adding, "success defined by being free from destructive habit. Richardson elaborated, "They no longer fall prey to that. Second definition is that they are employed. Third is getting involved, and attending a local church. Local church is God s support group and that is important to recovery." Men at the facility were seen being taken via bus to church on Sunday, where they entered via a basement door. They will spend 40 hours a week doing community service work and stay in "military-style barracks," a source told ET. No trespassing signs are abundant on the property. In May 2015, Josh Duggar admitted to molesting five young girls as a minor , and in July, the 27-year-old confessed to being unfaithful to his wife Anna after being discovered in a data breach to have two paid accounts on the affair-oriented website, Ashley Madison. Josh checked himself into rehab last week, possibly seeking treatment for his sexual issues.

Source:bluenationreview.com Author:Shawn Drury Emphasis Mine Despite what Republican presidential candidates may say, Hillary Clinton did not do anything illegal with her emails while Secretary of State . And she's definitely not being investigated for doing anything illegal . Earlier this week, the Justice Department responded to a request by a conservative group that wanted to review messages Clinton may have sent about a video the State Department broadcast in Pakistan. The response read, in part: "There is no question that former Secretary Clinton had authority to delete personal emails without agency supervision 〞 she appropriately could have done so even if she were working on a government server. Under policies issue both by the National Archives and Records Administration and the State Department, individual officers and employees are permitted and expected to exercise judgment to determine what constitutes a federal record." One would think this would close the door on any subsequent inquiries, but despite facts to the contrary, Republicans continue to deny climate change and promote conspiracy theories about Benghazi. As such, the Justice Department's findings won't stop a senate committee from calling former Clinton aides to testify about how she managed her email. Thank goodness they're focusing on the important issues of the day. See: http://bluenationreview.com/justice-department-finds-in-hillary-clintons-favor-on-email-question/

Created: 09/09/2015 9:22 PM KAALtv.com By: By MARY ESCH ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) 〞 New York s attorney general is demanding 13 manufacturers stop selling an obscure herbal remedy called devil s claw because DNA tests found samples contained a plant species different from the plant on their labels. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (SHNEYE -dur-muhn) says in letters sent Wednesday to manufacturers that DNA studies by the New York Botanical Garden found the supplements for arthritis contained a cheaper related species. Schneiderman says he reached an agreement with a 14th manufacturer to improve procedures to ensure its devil s claw contains only the labeled species. American Botanical Council industry group founder Mark Blumenthal says the two species noted by Schneiderman are almost identical and are considered interchangeable in devil s claw products. Schneiderman s actions are part of an ongoing investigation of the herbal supplement industry. (

MIDDLETOWN, Calif., Sept. 16 (UPI) -- Firefighters were slowly getting the upper hand early Wednesday on two massive wildfires in Northern California after one person died and hundreds of homes were leveled. Cooler temperatures and higher humidity have helped firefighters battle the deadly Valley Fire in Lake Napa and Sonoma counties. The 67,200-acre fire is about 30 percent contained after 585 homes were destroyed earlier in the week. Residents in the Riviera community were allowed back in their homes late Tuesday after being evacuated as the flames encroached. More than 2,600 firefighters continued to battle the blaze. Four were injured. Barbara McWilliams, 72, died when she couldn t make it out of her home as the fire approached. The retired teacher had advanced multiple sclerosis and was found dead in the burned rubble of her home. Several other people in the area were missing. Nearby, the so-called Butte Fire, affecting Amador and Calaversa counties, was 40 percent contained as of early Wednesday after 233 homes and 175 out buildings were destroyed. The fire has consumed 71,780 acres. Mandatory evacuations in the area have been lifted, but fires can return at any time, officials warned. "As residents return to their homes, please remember that an active fire is still ongoing, use caution as emergency vehicles and personnel are still in the area and be alert to any changes in fire conditions," officials said.

LITTLE ROCK 〞 Two arrests have been made in the theft of more than 50 head of cattle sold at auctions around Northwest Arkansas and southwest Missouri. Shane Joseph Horn, 30, of Valley Springs and Aaron Wesley Sayres, 29, of Harrison have both been charged with felony theft of property, according to a Wednesday news release from the office of Boone County Sheriff Mike Moore. Horn was taken into custody at the Farmers Livestock Auction in Springdale while in possession of stolen cattle, the release said. The Washington County Sheriff's Office assisted in the arrests. Boone County investigators working with Newton County Sheriff Keith Slape and the Arkansas State Police on reports of cattle thefts found that records from area livestock auctions showed Horn and Sayres had netted more than $67,000 in profits from cattle sales in a three-month period, the release said. The investigators determined Horn and Sayres obtained at least some of the stolen cattle from a 250-acre farm in the Alpena area of Boone County, the release said. Other cattle thefts have been reported in the area, and the investigation is ongoing. Horn and Sayres posted bond and are awaiting court appearances, the release said.

In this latest book in the long-running series, Kinsey finds herself with two cases: helping wealthy Hallie Bettancourt locate the son she gave up for adoption years ago, and unraveling the mystery of what former co-worker Pete Wolinsky was working on when he died. Both cases raise more questions than answers in the beginning, but, slowly, Kinsey s surveillance and investigation techniques bear fruit. In addition, her landlord, Henry, is concerned about how much water he is using everyday and Kinsey finds herself involved in that situation, too. While I enjoy reading about Kinsey and all her friends, the stories were slow moving and not that interesting, so a disappointment for me.

By | IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News 每 New Delhi, Sep 10 (IANS) The AAP on Thursday demanded quick action against the culprits in a case of alleged cop brutality in Nand Nagri area of the city. "The police have not taken any action against the accused police personnel. We demand that strict action should be initiated against the accused policemen," Aam Aadmi Party spokesman Ashutosh told media. He further accused Delhi Police of brushing the matter related to the mysterious death of Shahnawaz Chaudhary under the carpet and shielding the culprits. According to sources, 35-year-old Shanu Shahnawaz Chaudhary died under mysterious circumstances when he tried to intervene in a road-side scuffle between a couple and police in Nand Nagri area of east Delhi. A video clip which has gone viral on social networking sites purportedly shows a policeman thrashing the man with his club. The AAP leader also said that the party would approach the National Human Rights Commission to seek justice if police did not register an FIR.
U.S. small business confidence rose modestly in August, suggesting the economy continued to grow at a steady clip halfway through the third quarter. The National Federation of Independent Business said on Tuesday its Small Business Optimism Index gained half a point to 95.9 last month. Inside the minimum wage debate The NFIB said the survey of 656 businesses had not been impacted much by the recent turmoil in global financial markets, which was triggered by concerns over slowing economic growth in China. "Most of the interviews were completed before the big slide," the NFIB said in a statement. Marc Romanelli | Five of the index s 10 components increased last month, while three declined and two were unchanged. The survey s labor market gauges improved further last month, supporting the view that August s job growth slowdown was an aberration. The U.S. Labor Department reported on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased 173,000 last month, the smallest gain in five months. What US franchise businesses are worried about Small business owners were slightly optimistic about sales, but did not believe it was a good time to expand. Owners were pessimistic about business conditions over the next six months and were noncommittal regarding capital and inventory investment. The survey pointed to benign inflation pressures in the near term. Fourteen percent of small business owners reported reducing their average selling prices in the past three months, up one point from July. A net 15 percent planned to raise prices, down 2 points from July.

Sharkey, D-Hamden, said he "appreciate(s)" Fasano's concern that the $103 million in rescissions that Malloy announced Sept. 19 would hurt hospitals.

David Cameron has ordered three ministers to repay expenses debts after they were "named and shamed" by the Commons watchdog. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) named Tobias Ellwood, Edward Timpson and Caroline Dinenage among 26 current and former MPs who failed to settle sums of up to 500 last year, forcing them to be written off. Ipsa insisted it asked the individuals for the money several times, and warned them that their names would be published. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: "The Prime Minister s view is that he expects any ministers who owe money to pay it back. "I think a number of ministers are intending to do so."

Hosted again by state broadcaster ERT, the faceoff starts at 1800 and will see the two main contenders attempt to woo one in ten Greek voters that are still undecided, according to polls. Tsipras came to power in January promising to eliminate austerity, but was forced to accept a rescue package including more cuts, and ultimately resigned last month after a revolt by hardline eurosceptics wiped out his parliamentary majority.

WASHINGTON 〞 Religion, birth control and President Barack Obama s health care overhaul are about to collide at the Supreme Court yet again. Faith-affiliated charities, colleges and hospitals that oppose some or all contraception as immoral are battling the administration over rules that allow them to opt out of covering the contraceptives for women that are among a range of preventive services required to be in health plans at no extra cost. The religious-oriented nonprofit groups say the accommodation provided by the administration does not go far enough because they remain complicit in providing government-approved contraceptives to women covered by their plans, though the groups are not on the hook financially.

YAY! Made it past $3000! Thank you all so much for your generous (and often repeated) support! It is really great to be able to keep more of what you ve contributed and keep this going for pre-orders. I am worrying much less about producing 4 more paintings and the second calendar, as well as transporting art to the show and onward. It still pretty much covers only what s already spent, so keep spreading the word that you can get invites, calendars, prints etc here (and the first calendar here). The last model to (re)introduce did the music (an ethereal chillwave track called L.A.) for this Kickstarter s video! I also made a thematic mix tape.Star Amerasu Star performing at SF Pride last month (click for video) Star Amerasu has been a performer from the womb.

I hope you want a huge classical painting of her, or know someone who does, or will want the print. Who will the last painting be about? It is a mysteryCONTRIBUTE, SHARE. in diligent gratitude, Janet

Gypsy Thieves What angers thee From gypsy thieves within thy sleep Oh, rest upon thy bones As the pain shifts within thy chest While the gypsies whisper gently In the dark soulless night Committed to a wanting theft Before sweet dreams change to fright Behold the measurement of darkness While moonbeams waltz in white Waltzing silently before branding eyes Brightly lit within devious skies Stealing love in the hours of dark While the gypsy thieves spread their lies Spare me from the beast That feeds upon lambs in eve Wrestling away my thoughts of love For love was the mistress of my sleep In the counting of endless sheep Before the waiting to awake, awake, awake From dreams of gypsy thieves stealing my heart away from thee Let me feel thy lost hand To the touching of thy tiny fingertips Before the quickening of a rising sun With the inflection of the rooster's crow Holding my dreams that scream Carrying my true heart once more On the winds that blow As I wait and wait For the gypsy thieves to finally go All rights reserved 09/04/15 Orman Francis
After Gagik Tsarukyan resigned as leader of the Prosperous Armenia Party (BHK), the party said a firm "Yes" to the constitutional amendments initiated by Serzh Sargsyan. Did Tsarukyan hinder the party from saying "Yes?" "I would ask you not to link the question with persons," Secretary of the BHK faction Vahan Babayan said today. "If so, what prevented the party to approve Serzh Sargsyan's initiative after Sargsyan's harsh criticism against Tsarukyan on February 12?" Babayan gave a frank answer: 'we have reconsidered our position.' "All parties in all countries of the world make decisions depending on the political situation and challenges," he said. Asked what Vahan Babayan felt on February 12 when he heard Sargsyan's words given the sympathy for Sargsyan's project which he hid carefully from Tsarukyan, the BHK member said, "You had better do your own business." Together with the Republicans and Dashnaks, the BHK will participate in the "Yes" campaign."We cannot hide or act as observers," Vahan Babayan elaborated on their decision.

Currents from the North and Baltic seas have combined to make a part of the Swedish west coast one of the dirtiest in northern Europe, local media reported on Monday. Every year about 8,000 cubic meters worth of the garbage, the equivalent of five bathtubs worth every hour of a whole year, ends up on the upper part of the west coast, according to an analysis by the environmental group Keep Sweden Tidy cited by daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter. "Plastic is a fantastic material but it is completely absurd that packages to be used only once are made from a material that lasts over 100 years," said Dr. Eva Blidberg, a marine ecotoxigologist employed by the organization. The trash gathers and swirls in Skagerack sea just north of Denmark, where a stream from the North Sea runs into another current originating from the Baltic sea east of Sweden. While international public body OSPAR estimates that this strip of the west coast is the most littered in the northeast Atlantic, it estimates that only 15 percent of the trash washes ashore. "The garbage that is washed is what floats. We do not know how much is on the sea bed," said Martin Hassellov, a professor in analytical chemistry at Gothenburg University.

The Divergent series has never reached the culture-saturating heights of the Hunger Games movies, but it's done well for itself. Divergent and its awkwardly titled sequel, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, left fans satisfied and made their fare share of cash at the box office. The first trailer for The Divergent Series: Allegiant (ugh, that title) is preaching to the choir. No one put off by the first two films will be won over by this footage and no one who skipped the first two will be able to follow any of this, but this movie doesn't need your approval. It just needs the approval of the faithful. Continue reading＃

Comment ﹞ print ﹞ T T T+﹞ T- Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has given a three-month deadline to the health department officials to show visible improvement in health care services. Expressing shock over the Guntur incident where a newborn died after being bitten by rats, the Chief Minister said it was disturbing and unacceptable. At a meeting on general health, women and child welfare at the Secretariat here on Friday, Mr. Naidu proposed committee to standardise healthcare services across the State and evolve a set of tests that patients could undergo in government hospitals. "I want the infrastructure to be upgraded in all hospitals and a visible change within three months. There cannot be a compromise on hygiene or sanitation in hospitals," he warned. To monitor quality of the services in hospitals, Mr. Naidu directed officials to appoint an RDO-cadre officer as an administrator. "In addition to this, I want every medical facility to be geo-tagged and live data entered into the system." Responding to the suggestion that diagnostics could be outsourced to service providers under IDEA scheme, he said they would be outsourced to private organisations specialising in them.
An Afghan official says hundreds of Taliban fighters have launched a new attack on a strategic northern city, storming it from several directions. Sayed Sarwar Hussaini, the Kunduz provincial police chief s spokesman said Monday that the attack on the city started about 3 a.m. Battles with government forces are still underway in at least four locations, he says. So far, about 20 insurgents have been killed with confirmed casualties among security forces but no figure, he says. A tweet on a known Taliban Twitter account claimed responsibility. The tweet said all Kunduz city residents should remain indoors. Kunduz province is on a strategic crossroads connecting the four points of Afghanistan. It has been the scene of intense insurgent attacks since April, with the Taliban joining forces with other insurgents.

But 'miracle baby' Jaxon Buell has defied the＃ But not only has he defied the odds, he's gone from strength to strength 〞 and just celebrated his first birthday. "We did everything we could to give him a fighting chance and all he's done since being born is fight right back," Jaxon's dad, Brandon Buell, said. The Florida baby's incredible fight for survival has captivated families across the US, with more than 105,000 people liking his Facebook page and thousands sharing his story. Jaxon, whose nickname is Jaxon Strong, was born with an extreme birth defect called Microhydranencephaly, where the brain and skull don't form properly. About one in 4859 babies are born with the rare condition in America, but most die in the womb or shortly after birth. When Jaxon's parents Brittany and Brandon Buell discovered their unborn son's condition, they said their world collapsed.

Derry City have completed the signing of defender Ben McLaughlin, subject to a medical and international clearance. The former Everton U21 player, who is grandson of treble winning ex-Derry boss Jim, has signed until the end of the season. City boss Peter Hutton was happy to have added the 20-year-old to his squad. "We're delighted to finally get it done. Ben was keen to come and sign until the end of the season and just get his career going again. "His grandfather was obviously a massive figure in the club's history but he will be a great addition to the squad. "He is naturally a right back and can play right wing-back as well. He brings that versatility which is good because we still have such a small squad. "There's nothing stopping him getting his confidence back again at Derry after leaving Everton. He can get playing again on a regular basis and possibly get back across the water again further down the line."

MORGAN HILL (CBS SF) 每 A distinguished community service figure is fulfilling a long-held dream by accompanying U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, on a trip to Washington D.C. to hear Pope Francis address Congress next week. Lofgren's office announced Thursday that it invited Maria Skoczylas, 89, to hear the Sept. 24 address. The Morgan Hill resident wrote numerous letters to political leaders in hopes of attending the upcoming talk, saying "it would be the greatest pleasure of (her) life." Lofgren's office stated that because Skoczylas has dedicated herself to the cause of helping homeless people for nearly three decades, she embodies the life Pope Francis calls on people to lead. A former schoolteacher, Skoczylas remains involved in the community by sitting on the board of directors for five local charities. In June, Skoczylas was selected by NeighborWorks America, a nationwide nonprofit supporting community development, as a recipient of the Dorothy Richardson Award for Resident Leadership based on her efforts. When the Pope visits the U.S. Capitol next week, he will become the first pontiff to address a joint meeting of Congress. Copyright 2015 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service.

(Message by Tanny Keng) 1. Martyrdom a) As Christian's it is our destiny to become glorified. The Bible says that we are predestined to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ. By getting to know God through His Word, prayer, and even life circumstances all come together for our good taking us into a glorified life in Christ. (Romans 8:28-30 NKJV) And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified. b) Only when we keep a clear focus on God are we transformed into the image of God from glory to glory as we see Him more clearly, as we get to know His character better, His love. The glory of God is the manifestation and revelation of His love. (2 Corinthians 3:18 NKJV) But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord. c) We go from one manifestation and revelation of God's love to the next manifestation and revelation of His love, glory to glory. This process transforms us into His image. The End ...

Swans premiership player Tadhg Kennelly says the pressure is on Fremantle tonight to beat Hawthorn, with star Nat Fyfe the one to lead the Dockers to victory. Despite the Hawks chasing a third successive premiership, Kennelly says the heat is on the Dockers who have had the break to prepare. "There's more pressure on Fyfe, there's more pressure on Freo to get the result," Kennelly said. "It's strange saying that when you look at Hawthorn going for the threepeat, but Freo have had the week off, they've had all the preparation ＃ and Fyfe is the one they need to get going. "He's the one that's going to have the biggest influence if they have a chance." Kennelly said, in comparison, Hawk Sam Mitchell gets the possessions but is nowhere as damaging as Fyfe, who he says needs to be stopped for the Hawks to win. Kennelly says Hawthorn has the momentum going its favour and has tipped the Hawks to make their fourth straight Grand Final after blowing away Adelaide last week. "I'm going to go with the Hawks because of the mojo that they got back last weekend and that defensive pressure," Kennelly said. "Thirteen turnovers resulting in goals and the ball the use 每 it's a joy to watch." The preliminary final begins at 6.20pm tonight at Perth's Domain Stadium. Do you agree with Tadhg?

easyhome Ltd., a provider of goods and alternative financial services, has changed its legal corporate name to goeasy Ltd. At the same time, the Company will be changing its TSX symbol from EH to GSY. The change in the Company s legal name comes as it marks the one year anniversary of the launch of its master brand, goeasy, which was created to provide a corporate umbrella that unites and supports its sub-brands of easyhome and easyfinancial. "Given the success of our goeasy master brand initiative, it is a natural transition to align the corporate parent company to goeasy Ltd.," said David Ingram, goeasy s President and CEO. The change reflects both the evolution and growth in the business as it moves from a name that was aligned with the legacy leasing business to a corporate name that encompasses all of the Company s business units and its ambition to add new goeasy brands as it executes against its strategic goals. "By the end of 2015, easyfinancial will generate a greater portion of the Company s revenue and earnings," continued Mr Ingram. "As we look towards the future, we will be recognized more for our financial services and so the distinction from our legacy business is important."
Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has undergone a specialist procedure in America in an attempt to cure an ongoing heel problem. The midfielder travelled to the United States on Monday to seek expert advice from New Jersey-based Dr John Cozzarelli. Press Association Sport understands since arriving he has been assessed and has undergone a procedure which involves a series of injections but he has not had surgery. Henderson has missed the last three matches with the problem and in his absence the team have earned just one point, in a goalless draw at Arsenal. The side has missed his dynamism and particularly his forward running but with no date set for his return, Rodgers has to find a way of rejuvenating his midfield as the triumvirate of James Milner, Emre Can and Lucas Leiva struggled in defeats against West Ham and Manchester United.

A police officer had her face slashed with a screwdriver while trying to detain a 59-year-old man under the Mental Health Act. Police were called by a mental health team to a home in Elmwood Crescent, Colindale in Brent, north west London. The health team wanted help taking the man to hospital yesterday after he refused to go with them voluntarily. The officer went into the home and tried to speak to the man but he refused to answer. He then barricaded himself inside one of the room. After the officers managed to get through the barricade he then tried to attack the three officers with a screwdriver. The man then slashed one of the officers, a probationary PC in her 20s from Wembley Police Station, across the forehead resulting in a cut half an inch long. She has since been released from hospital and the other officers did not need hospital treatment. The man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and detained under the Mental Health Act.
Remember Corey Clark from Season 2 of "American Idol?" Yes, that Corey Clark. The one who was rumored to be gettin' it in with Paula Abdul? Well, he was arrested again Wednesday night in Arizona for felony domestic violence, according to TMZ. On top of the domestic violence charge, Clark was also booked for aggravated harassment and failure to comply. In a follow up report from TMZ, we learned this: According to Clark's arrest report, there were several instances where he violated a protective order his wife had against him. The report says he was only allowed to communicate with Monica Clark via email and only to discuss their children. Monica says Clark took it one step too far when she stopped replying to his emails. She claims he started to follow her, and in one instance, Corey allegedly sat outside a restaurant where she was eating dinner, and stared for hours. In the docs, Monica says Clark hounded her about her new relationship in emails 〞 which would be a clear violation of the protective order. Clark, by the way, sued Fox after he was dropped from the show for not disclosing a prior arrest. He had been arrested after a scuffle with his sister. He pleaded no contest.

Back in July, Lana Del Rey kicked off the album campaign for her highly anticipated Honeymoon album. Releasing the album's title track, along with ' High By The Beach ' and ' Terrence Loves You ,' Lana made sure that her supportive fan-base had more than enough to hold them over until the September 18th album release date. Well, it looks like she's not done delivering new music just yet as a snippet of 'Music To Watch Boys To' has surfaced. Letting her calming vocals take center stage, the lack of instrumentation in the 'Music To Watch Boys To' snippet gives off a feeling that the record may be leading up to something explosive. Slated to release on September 11th, be the judge yourself and listen to the snippet, below.

Kate Winslet has revealed she has no regrets about starring in Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs biopic. The film, which stars Michael Fassbender as the late Apple co-founder, has been panned by critics. [embedded content] Kate, who plays Joanna Hoffman, who worked closely with Jobs from the early days of Apple Computer, said: "I have no reservations whatsoever and so excited to be a part of this project." Based on Walter Isaacson's book of the same name, the film has been written by Aaron Sorkin. It was shot like a play, and told in three acts. "Each act covers a different year: 1984, 1988, and 1998 in Steve Jobs' creative working life. We shot each act in chronological order, one act at a time," Kate explained. Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs (Universal) While the Oscar-winning actress expressed that making the film was educational, she admitted it was a "tough, but fascinating process". "It was very, very challenging. It's 187 pages of continuous dialogue of just people talking," she said. "It was very hard for all of us to really come up with what Danny (Boyle) wanted and needed to put this film together." Share article Steve Jobs, which also stars Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels, will close the BFI London Film Festival on October 18, before opening in UK cinemas nationwide on November 13.
Berlin, Dhu-AlQa dah 26, 1436, September 10, 2015, SPA -- Germany can deal with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees without cutting social welfare benefits or raise taxes, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Thursday during a debate in parliament on next year s budget, dpa reported. Germany expects 800,000 asylum seekers this year, four times more than last year and more than any other country in the European Union, which is split on how to deal with the biggest refugee crisis since World War II. The German government earlier this week approved a 6-billion-euro (6.7-billion-dollar) package to finance the migrant inflow. This includes 3 billion euros in the 2016 budget and as much to help federal states whose resources are being squeezed. Gabriel said Germany would be able to finance the costs given its stable fiscal position and its strong economy, which the government expects to grow 1.8 per cent this and next year. Gabriel appealed to German businesses and politicians to speed up the integration of migrants by offering vocational training. He said migrants would be beneficial to an economy whose workforce is projected to shrink by 6 million by 2030. --SPA 11:40 LOCAL TIME 08:40 GMT

Virgin Atlantic Airways added its second US route from its Scottish operation at Glasgow (GLA), with Las Vegas (LAS) joining its existing thrice-weekly Orlando flights. The weekly (Thursdays) seasonal route which began on 10 September only operates until 1 October, utilising one of the airline's 455-seat 747-400s. The 7,881-kilometre sector will face direct competition from Thomas Cook Airlines, which operates the city pair on Mondays with one of its A330s. Other US services offered from Glasgow this summer include American Airlines' daily Philadelphia route, United Airlines' daily New York Newark operation, Thomson Airways' weekly rotation to Orlando Sanford and Thomas Cook Airlines' twice-weekly run to Orlando. Steven Marshall, Marketing and Commercial Insight Manager at Glasgow Airport said: "This is fantastic news for Scottish travellers. Las Vegas is considered the entertainment capital of the world and is an extremely popular destination 每 this new route from Virgin Atlantic is sure to be popular with our customers. We are very proud to have a strong brand such as Virgin Atlantic operating from Glasgow Airport. The airline's Florida service has grown in popularity every year since launching in 2007 and we are confident Las Vegas will prove to be equally successful." aenna

Day 16 of 30 paintings in 30 days... "The Group" Watercolor and ink 14 x 11 inches Click to Bid Today instead of starting a new painting I decided to ask myself "what if" while going through some watercolors that were complete, but I was not really happy about. I was curious what adding some ink lines to the paintings would do. What did I have to loose...nothing. I got so involved with this I ended up reworking 3 paintings today. The Tulips were first, next up a couple cat paintings... the original watercolor Added some line work with ink.... But didn t stop there, decided a cropped version looked much better.... "do Not Disturb" 6 x 8 inched matted to 11 x 14 inches Click to Bid One more to go..added some ink work... Then again did some cropping, (one of the things I love about watercolors is the ability to crop them if needed) "So" 8 x 6 inches matted to 14 x 11 inches Click to Bid All in all a pretty productive day :) Mary

No, not Suez, the Panama widening or even the one proposed for Nicaragua. This one is in the Middle East. The 950km long Salman Canal will link the Arabian Gulf with the Arabian Sea, 630km in Saudi Arabia and 320km in Yemen. The Arab Century Centre for Studies that has proposed the canal said it will be 150 metres wide and 25 metres deep, allowing Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE to export their oil and gas, avoiding the Strait of Hormuz, the same Straits with all those awkward geopolitical issues. An alternative route avoids Yemen and goes through Oman instead. They estimate the canal will cost $80 Billion, much of the cost due to the 700m above sea level obstacles in Oman and Yemen. It is only a proposal at this stage but like pipelines, it could have a significant impact on the politics of the region. 
ARGENTINE prosecutors say they ve detained a man who kept his troubled wife and autistic son locked in a cage for at least two years.

Seattle clothing retailer Butch Blum has announced that it will be hosting a special screening of the film "The True Cost," which examines the troubled relationship that the United States fashion industry has with so-called "fast fashion." The film has been heralded as a critical look at what it takes to get the fashion American consumers seem to crave into retail stores, from the people that make them to the impact that production has on the world. It was filmed in countries around the world, from the brightest runways to the darkest slums, and featurs interviews with some of the world's leading fashion influencers including Stella McCartney, Livia Firth and Vandana Shiva. It has been called "a portrait of exploitation" by The New York Times , "staggering" by the Los Angeles Times , and "a sweeping, heartbreaking and damning survey of the clothing industry" by CNN. The store is partnering with the Seattle Independent Film Festival on the showing, which happens in-store on Monday, Sept. 21 beginning at 5pm, with a pre-screening happy hour cocktail served at 4:30 pm. To secure your place, email the store s promotions department or call 206-622-5760 before Sept. 18. Butch Blum is located in downtown Seattle at 1332 Sixth Avenue, between University and Union Streets.

Sept. 1, 2015 _ Education Minnesota President Denise Specht released the following statement in response to the new state accountability report. "We received more good news about Minnesota education today," Specht. "Our schools were recently credited in CNBC's decision to rank Minnesota as its best state for business. Last week, our students were called tops in the nation on the ACT. Now we're seeing real progress on closing gaps in test scores and graduation rates." "However, we would be more excited about these results if we had faith in the underlying testing data from the Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments," Specht said. "We really don't know if the school-level data are valid because of the multiple failures with the testing system last spring. If Minnesota is going to make policy based on MCA scores, our state needs to make sure the results are trustworthy."

The response also: sets out plans for NHS England to continue working with the NHS in Wales to refresh the informal forum that has previously brought together NHS bodies from both sides of the border explains that difficulties in recruiting GPs in Wales are being addressed by the Welsh government in the first instance (rather than by taking up the committee's suggestion for a UK-wide performers list for GPs restates the UK government policy to give people resident in England secondary care that has been commissioned in England and promises a later update

By Peter Loftus Drug maker AbbVie Inc. is hiring a top investment banker from J.P. Morgan to a newly created senior strategy post, a sign that AbbVie plans to remain active on the deal front. AbbVie, a J.P. Morgan client, is naming Henry Gosebruch as its chief strategy officer, reporting to Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez effective in December, both companies said Wednesday. Mr. Gosebruch, 42 years old, is currently co-head of North America mergers and acquisitions for J.P. Morgan, and has been with the firm since 1994, J.P. Morgan said. At AbbVie, his responsibilities will include strategic planning, licensing and acquisitions, and managing alliances with other companies, an AbbVie spokesman said. These functions have previously been split between other senior AbbVie executives. AbbVie created the new post and tapped Mr. Gosebruch because "we recognized the increasingly important role that corporate strategy and business development will continue to play in our future success, and this will enable us to enhance our focus on those areas," the AbbVie spokesman said. AbbVie has been in the hunt for large deals recently. In May, it paid $21 billion to purchase blood-cancer drug developer Pharmacyclics. Last year it agreed to buy Shire PLC for about $54 billion, but subsequently abandoned the deal. J.P. Morgan said Anu Aiyengar will become sole head of North America M she has served as co-head with Mr. Gosebruch. Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com
Jose Mourinho is still to win a Premier League game at Newcastle, but the Chelsea boss must have felt like he was celebrating a victory after his side came from two goals down to rescue a 2-2 draw on Saturday. Trailing to goals from Ayoze Perez and Georginio Wijnaldum, the reigning champions looked like suffering a fourth defeat in the space of seven Premier League matches when they were still 2-0 behind with 11 minutes left at St James Park. But after Brazilian midfielder Ramires clawed a goal back with a sensational long-range finish, his compatriot Willian s floated free-kick found its way beyond Tim Krul in the 86th minute to complete a gritty comeback from the visitors.

FIVE PEOPLE HAVE been killed and two others are missing after an avalanche in the French Alps. The avalanche struck around midday at the Snow Dome in the Alps' Massif des Ecrins, an easy-to-access 4,015-metre mountain that is hugely popular with climbers. "One person is thought to be ok or slightly injured," an official, Pierre Besnard, told AFP. The avalanche swept away eight people. Rescuers are still searching for the two missing. Climbers and skiers are sporadically caught in avalanches in the popular Alps, particularly during the winter season. Last winter, at least 28 people died in avalanches in France.

Went downtown with the boy on Saturday and stopped by Pan Am Plaza to check out some Futsal. We're both Soccer (MLS & EPL) fans but neither of us have ever heard of Futsal before! This was titled the "Mayor's International Futsal Cup 2015" & there was a pretty large turnout for the event. In a nutshell this is 5 on 5 soccer played on a small, hard court using a smaller ball. Unlike he full-sized game scoring is done quite frequently & it's non-stop action. We took some pictures and made a few court-side recordings with the GoPro (I'll post those after I get a chance to edit the footage). Once the rain stopped it was a great way to spend a few hours downtown!
Miley Cyrus hosted an X-rated MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) after-party, decorated with fake drugs and sex toys. The 22-year-old star enlisted her pal Jeff Beacher to help her celebrate hosting the ceremony on Sunday night (08.30.15) and he reportedly transformed his Hollywood night club Beacher s Madhouse into an ice cream-themed fantasy-land, which also featured flying little people dressed as ice cream cones. An insider told E! News: "There were fake lines of cocaine on the tables and people bobbing for penis toys in a vat of milk." A customized cake featured a Barbie doll throwing up in a toilet. The source claims the We Can t Stop hitmaker spent the night twerking on stage with her dancers and smoking marijuana. Big Sean, Vanessa Hudgens, Kylie Jenner, Jared Leto and Rita Ora were among the well-known guests at the party in the club at The Hollywood Roosevelt hotel. Miley s current love interest Stella Maxwell also attended the bash even though the starlet, who was previously engaged to Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, recently insisted they aren t in an exclusive relationship. She previously said: "I m very open about it - I m pansexual. But I m not in a relationship. "I m 22, I m going on dates, but I change my style every two weeks, let alone who I m with."
Scotland head coach Vern Cotter has been forced to make two changes to his team for Sunday s World Cup clash with the United States in Leeds after John Hardie was ruled out with a head knock. The New Zealand-born flanker, who scored his first try for his adopted nation in Wednesday s crushing win over Japan, is replaced by Ryan Wilson, who moves up from the bench. But with the Scots short on cover in the loose forwards, versatile hooker Fraser Brown has been forced to give up his starting slot in order to act as back-row back-up, with his place going to Ross Ford. Kevin Bryce also comes into the matchday squad to take the replacement hooker role vacated by Ford. Hardie sustained his head injury during the 45-10 thrashing of the Brave Blossoms in Gloucester. Share article A statement from the Scottish medics said: " Having produced inconclusive results to a precautionary HIA 2 (head injury assessment) after Wednesday s win over Japan, the openside - who remains symptom free - was reassessed yesterday afternoon (Friday). "It was here that, 48-hours after the game (HIA 3), Hardie failed one component of the tested elements (Cogstate), and was subsequently considered unavailable for tomorrow s game. He will now continue with his graduated return-to-play protocol."

I am typing this while standing in line to board a plane每 yes, really, so bear with me in my brevity. I woke this morning, read the chapter and was puzzled as to which verse to highlight. I couldn't sit still and ponder much, as, well, I've got this flight. And so, here I am. On my drive in I thought about using the entire chapter but then, in reading the chapter again, I found one verse that grabbed me. Here's what I heard in Psalm 22 using SOAP: Scripture: Psalm 22:26 The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek Him shall praise the Lord! Observation: All that need Him who seek Him will get what they need. Application: You REALLY need to read the whole thing to get what I got today, but I felt this somewhat summed it up: He is always there, even when we are down and feeling lost. Those calling out to Him will be heard and He will help, even when it feels as though He is far. Prayer: Please, Lord, let all who seek you hear you and see you. In their despair, please let them know you are there, listening and guiding always. I love you, Lord. Thank you for always being here for me and all who seek you.

Hundreds of thousands of jobs would be created if the Government cut VAT on food and drink from 20% to 10%, according to a new report. A campaign group said 425,000 new jobs would be created, with a further 150,000 if VAT was reduced to 5%. Jacques Borel said research by his VAT Club found that cuts in other EU countries led to price reductions and increased customer demand. He said: "The high rates of VAT applying to pubs, restaurants, hotels and catering businesses in the UK is restraining the growth of the UK hospitality industry. "Also the increase in the minimum wage will result in increased costs for businesses in the leisure and hospitality industries and a VAT cut would offer a viable solution to this. "By lowering the rate of VAT in the sector, the Government will reduce the unfair competition from supermarkets which benefit from the zero VAT rates that apply to the food it sells and which is used to subsidise the sale of alcoholic drinks." The group, backed by dozens of food and drink companies, will submit a report to the Government, claiming that reducing VAT to 10% will lead to a surplus for the Treasury of 111 million after three years.

Cargo volumes rise 42 per cent to 443,012 tonnes in H1 2015 Dubai, UAE 每 September 1, 2015 每 Cargo volumes at Al Maktoum International - Dubai World Central (DWC) continued to rise sharply in the first half of 2015, as the airport continues to rise up the ranks of the top cargo airports worldwide edging into the 19 th position up from 20 th earlier in the year. Freight volumes surged 42 per cent in the first half of 2015 to 443,012 tonnes, up from the 311,365 tonnes achieved in the same period last year. The growth was driven by Dubai Airports' strategic decision to relocate all dedicated freighters from Dubai International to DWC in May last year. Passenger traffic for the period totalled 209,989in the first half of 2015 down 64 per cent from the 578,129passengers recorded in the same period last year due to the surge in volumes created by the temporary relocation of 300 flights per week while the runway refurbishment programme was conducted at Dubai International. Aircraft movements totalled 20,866 in the first half of 2015, down 17 per cent from the 25,184 movements achieved in the same period last year. "The story is only just beginning for DWC but the early results continue to impress," said Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports. "The airport is quickly emerging as an important cargo hub and with the addition of 70 weekly flydubai flights to 7 new destinations in October we expect the airport to soon establish itself as an important gateway to the Middle East." Once flydubai operations commence this October, DWC will offer passengers a total of 190 weekly flights to 17 destinations.

Lethbridge 每 It was a fire that destroyed decades of records and memories 每 some good, many terrible. Story continues below Originally thought to be electrical in origin, last month's fire that gutted Red Crow Community College is now the focus of an arson investigation. After two weeks of investigation, the office of the Fire Commissioner determined the fire was intentionally set. Members of the Blood Tribe were filled with mixed emotions when the college, a former residential school, was destroyed August. 14. Blood Tribe Police Staff Sergeant Joseph Many Fingers updated the investigation on Wednesday. "At this point I believe somebody from the community knows what happened," said Many Fingers. "So, if anybody has any information, please feel free to give the Blood Tribe Police Service a call. We also have the tips at ( www.BloodTribePolice.com ) or they can call Crime Stoppers." Police do not have any suspects. Insurance adjusters have estimated the cost of the damage to be close to $11 million.

But Kentucky legislators have sued to say it s unconstitutional restriction of free speech to set caps on campaign contributions and to prohibit lobbyists from giving them gifts or cocktail parties. Please. Nobody tell Sen. Jon Woods about this. * NO COMMENT: Brian Chjilson sent this cell phone photo alongside the highway at Harrison, Ark., a former "sundown town" that numbers about 40 black people according to recent Census data and which is the postoffice address, coincidentally, for a leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

We're still 90 days away from The Force Awakens blasting into theaters, but the rumor mill around Star Wars Episode VIII is already in hyperspace. So far, we've been told that the Rian Johnson-directed feature is shooting in Ireland this month and will feature Mark Hamill reprising his role as Luke Skywalker, according to The Irish Examiner But that may not be the case after all, Del Toro told USA TODAY when asked about the rumors. "That's just something people are saying. I don't know whether it's good to contradict it or feed it, because I don't know. But it's kind of cool to be a part of." The Sicario star did confirm that he'll start shooting in February or March. And while all the goodwill around Force has been nice, it wasn't what ultimately convinced him to sign on for the eighth chapter. "It's like, 'What do you do with that character?' It's open what you do with it, so it's like, 'Oh, I can do this, I can do that.' I read the script and the script was good. Even if it wasn't a 'Star Wars' episode, it's got a story that I enjoy reading. So it's cool. It's cool to be in a franchise thing like this." As expected, he has to stay tight-lipped. Guess we'll know more in 2

CORVALLIS, Ore. -- Stanford quarterback Kevin Hogan looked prepared to play during warm-ups Friday night at Oregon State. The fifth-year senior, who has a 26-9 career record, moved well on his sprained left ankle while throwing from the pocket. "It s just physical: If he can do it, he ll play," Stanford coach David Shaw said earlier in the week. "And it might be a combination of where he can play and not do everything. We ll see how it goes." Hogan was injured in the third quarter of the victory at USC and did not participate in practice until Thursday, when he had a light but encouraging workout, according to Shaw. Hogan used Stanford s Virtual Reality system to prepare for Oregon State s defensive schemes. He hasn t missed a game since becoming the starter in November 2012.

8:22 p.m. CDT LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Kim Richards, a star on reality television show "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills," was sentenced on Monday to three years of probation and 30 days of community service after resisting arrest for public intoxication and trespassing at a hotel. Former child actress Richards, 50, pleaded no contest and was also ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous for a year, Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Rosa Zavala said in a statement. A representative for Comcast Corp s NBC Universal, the parent company of Bravo which airs the series, had no comment. The reality star was arrested April 16 after a reported disturbance at the upscale Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She also was accused of kicking an officer in the leg at the police station. Richards and her sister Kyle have been regular cast members of "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" since the show s 2010 premiere of "Real Housewives," which follows the exploits of several affluent women in one of the nation s most well-heeled zip codes. The show s fifth season ended this summer. The Richards are half-sisters to Kathy Hilton, the mother of socialite Paris Hilton and spouse of luxury hotel magnate Richard Howard Hilton. Last month, Kim Richards spent a night in jail after being arrested on suspicion of shoplifting $600 of goods from a Target store in Los Angeles. She was released after posting a $5,000 bond.

Josh Windass scored a quick fire double Josh Windass quick-fire first-half double set Accrington on their way to a 4-2 win over Exeter. Stanley boss John Coleman celebrated a year back in charge of the Reds in style - although there were nerves as they led 4-0 at one point before the Grecians came back. Two goals in a minute changed the game after an even start. Piero Mingoia s cross from the right was stroked home by Windass for his third of the season in the 33rd minute. And his fourth came less than a minute later when a mistake by goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik allowed Windass to nip in and fire past the stranded keeper from 18 yards. Stanley could have had a third after 37 minutes but Olejnik made amends by pushing out Sean McConville s near-post effort and the keeper also denied Windass a hat-trick. Exeter boss Paul Tisdale made changes during the early stages of the second half but it was Stanley who struck next in the 61st minute when Billy Kee set up Mingoia in the area and he fired low into the far corner of the net. And, after 63 minutes, Kee latched on to Matt Crooks pass and he finished well from 15 yards to make it 4-0. However, Exeter got one back through a scrambled effort from a corner with 15 minutes remaining, given after the match to Lee Holmes, and sub Joel Grant found the roof of the net at the death to make it 4-2.

Cairo 〞 Politician and business magnate Ahmed Ezz was excluded from the initial list of approved candidates for the upcoming parliamentary elections on Wednesday. His lawyer, Mohamed Tanwir said Ezz is considering an appeal. This is second time Ezz is excluded from running. He had applied to run for a seat in parliament last February, before the elections were postponed based on a court order. Ezz, a prominent politician during the era of former president Hosni Mubarak, had presented his candidacy papers on Thursday. Egypt s parliamentary elections are due to be held over two phases in October and November. Towards the end of Mubarak s 30-year-rule, Ezz had taken centre stage because of his political and business activities. He once served as head of the policies secretariate in the now defunct National Democratic Party, the ruling party under Mubarak. He came to be known as a steel tycoon after chairing Ezz Steel, which monopolised the steel sector in Egypt. Ezz was arrested after the 2011 uprising which toppled Mubarak. Charges were brought against him in five different court cases. He was handed several prison sentences which were overturned by Egypt s Court of Cassation. He was released in August 2014 after being ordered to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in fines for monopolistic practices. Last month, a court upheld a decision to seize the assets of Ezz and his family until an investigation on the sources of his wealth is completed.
And THIS is exactly the reason why it would be a nightmare having everybody walking around with a sidearm waiting to get all John Wayne the moment they smell an incident occurring. Houston police say that an armed man's attempt to stop a carjacking went terribly wrong on Saturday night when he shot the vehicle's owner in the head, then fled the scene. According to KHOU Channel 11 News, the shooting took place around 11:15 p.m. at a Valero gas station in north Houston. Police officials say that two men jumped the owner of a Chevrolet pickup truck and absconded with his vehicle. As the men struggled with the car-owner, a passerby produced a gun and fired multiple shots, missing the thieves but striking the victim in the head. The shooter quickly gathered up his shell casings from the pavement and fled the scene. The injured man was rushed to a nearby hospital where he is currently in stable condition.
Bills head coach Rex Ryan has seen enough of New England s offensive game plans over the years that he has a pretty good idea which running back the Patriots will be deploying against his Bills defense this week. Knowing that the Patriots frequently change who the feature back is in a given week, Ryan has little doubt who Buffalo s run front will be dealing with Sunday. "Yeah (LeGarrette) Blount," said Ryan. "That's who it's going to be. That's who it would've been Week 1. The other kid is who he is. Blount is their guy and I know him he's a big, tough, stud running back. We throw in this other dude, hey guess what? He ain't going to play. They'll put him in on third down, but he's not going to be out there. They're going to put Blount back there." Blount has had good success against the Bills in the past. In his last two games against Buffalo he has 251 yards on 34 carries and a pair of touchdowns. His yards per carry average in those two games is 7.38.

The actress, who announced she is gay in February last year, debuted her first public relationship with a woman at the Toronto International Film Festival in Canada on Sunday. Page tells E!

The two women both wore tuxedos on the red carpet for Page s new film, which stars Julianne Moore as a policewoman who fights for her partner, played by Page, to be entitled to her pension after being diagnosed with cancer.
The shutdown called by the trade unions against the central government s economic measures on Wednesday hit the commuters most as over 2,000 state roadways buses went off road. However, the state government offices and educational institutions were functioning normally and there was no report of violence anywhere in the state. The impact of the shutdown was more in major towns like Shimla, Rampur, Theog, Solan, Mandi, Nahan, Una, Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Dharamsala, Palampur, Kangra, Kullu and Manali as private bus operators also joined the protest. An official of the Himachal Road Transport Corporation said more than 250 inter-state routes were badly hit due to the strike. "The supply of milk to the state from the neighbouring state Punjab was also hit due to the shutdown," a police official told IANS here. The Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) also joined the strike in protest against indifferent attitude of the state government towards the problems of the fruit growers.
Its been 20 days since I arrived at Logan International airport on 27 August 2015 around 2 pm. My adjustment is going pretty well due to the huge support from current Indonesian Bostonian fellow here! Special thanks for Andrea, a friend of mine from the same scholarship batch who help me a lot with the moving (and everything!) and hosted me 1 week at her place! I couldnt imagine everything will be a lot difficult without their present. I come to Boston with only 1 way ticket. Will I ever know when I am going back to the other part of the world where I belong to? It could be next year, maybe couple months later, next 2 years, or how if I will only come back after 3 years? When you bought 1 way ticket, you never really know when you will go back. This remind me of the song played at the Chicago Jazz Festival last 2 weeks called "1 Way Ticket" where the singer bought 1 way ticket to India and never know when she will go back. But one thing is definite; I will come back for the stronger reason than staying here. "No reason to stay, is a good reason to go" is that right? :)

Police say gunmen shot and killed a 3-year-old boy and his father in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Police Inspector-General Syed Javaid Mujtaba Gillani blamed militants fighting against Indian rule for the killings late Friday. A police officer said Saturday that gunmen sprayed bullets at Bashir Ahmed, himself a former militant, outside his home as he was carrying his son in northern Sagipora village in Indian Kashmir s Sopore region. Ahmed died on the spot, while his son died Saturday. Sopore has seen a recent spate of similar attacks on civilians and former militants. Meanwhile, villagers on Saturday discovered the bullet-riddled body of a militant in an orchard in Indian Kashmir s Tangmarg area. Police and anti-India separatists blamed each other for the killing. Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both.
Fix Auto UK is lending its support to a classic Mini Cooper that will compete in the 2016 Mintex MSA British Historic Rally Championship. The Leicester-based operation has agreed to be a sponsor of the classic car built in 1963 and driven by Phil Harris, the principal at Harris & Co, one of the country's leading chartered accountants and business advisors to both the automotive and motorsport sectors. Phil, who first stepped into a rally car at the tender age of 13, has made a remarkable return to the sport in a car he has owned since 1976 with four class wins from four starts after a 25-year hiatus in order to concentrate on his business. The success in 2015 has already ensured class glory in the Mintex MSA British Historic Rally Championship with three rounds yet to go and also places him third in the highly competitive category one division that encompasses all historic pre-1968 rally cars no matter the engine size. Ian Pugh, of Fix Auto UK said, 'We are delighted to be supporting Harris & Co Mini in the UK's premier historic rally championship for 2016. The car has been fantastically successful this year with four class wins out of four and, as a leader in the automotive repair business, it's a great way for us to display our own philosophy of being a front runner too.' Phil Harris said, 'We have a long association with the automotive sector and the chance to work alongside a leading brand such as Fix Auto UK is very exciting.'
sometimes I take images of things because I want to remember how the subject looked and how it was presented to me in real life. I want the visual note so I can incorporate it into the things that I write about. The images become reminders for me and at the same time they seem to me to be quixotic and serial segments of life in the real world. A concept in seeing the flow of modern life as it exists now. In the moment. In this instance. It will all change next week. Next year. Tomorrow. This will be a memory that provides a context when I think back about this particular period of time. It may not be relevant to anyone else. But should that matter?

NBC NEWS - Taco Bell is thinking outside the bun. The fast food chain is taking a cue from its corporate cousin KFC and will now serve a taco shell made of fried chicken. Called the "Naked Crispy Chicken Taco," the new menu item consists of a fried chicken shell filled with lettuce, cheese, tomato and avocado ranch sauce, according to Foodbeast, an online publication that specializes in food news. Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, is no stranger to food mash-ups. KFC released several hybrid chicken products in the recent years including the Double Down Sandwich, Double Down Dog -- which use fried chicken filets in place of buns -- and the "Chizza," a pizza with chicken for crust. Similarly, Pizza Hut introduced new crust flavors last year, offering salted pretzel, honey sriracha and toasted asiago to its pizzas.

The rand has retreated against the dollar, mainly tracking weaker Asian markets as investors remained concerned about the global impact of growth in＃ Johannesburg - The rand retreated against the dollar on Thursday, mainly tracking weaker Asian markets as investors remained concerned about the global impact of sluggish growth in China. On the local bourse, the blue-chip Top-40 futures index was down 0.64%, a move likely to translate in the actual share index opening 283 points lower at 09:00. Stuttering output in the world s second largest economy has pushed commodity prices lower, hitting emerging markets like South Africa that export to the world s second-largest economy. Traders and analysts said mining and manufacturing production data due out at 11:30 and 13:00 would provide key pointers on whether the domestic economy could be headed for a recession after contracting in the second quarter. At 08:49 the rand traded 0.44% softer at R13.8600/$ compared with Wednesday s close in New York. The rand has lost nearly 20% of its value against the dollar since the start of the year, victim to concerns about lacklustre domestic growth and a general sell-off in emerging markets as US interest rates＃
A few years ago, Ricoh launched its odd little 360 camera, the Theta. Since then we've seen countless others. But how many of them allow you to dump your images and footage on Google Maps? The new Rioch Theta S looks basically the same as the last model but it's got some improved specs. The camera now shoots 14 megapixel images, and can record video 1920 x 1080 video for up to 29 minutes. The new camera has a 1/2.3-inch sensor, which is apparently slightly larger than the imaging chip on the last model. This should make for better quality images. The new camera coincides with the launch of the new Google Street View App, which allows you to upload spherical images to Google Maps. What a coincidence! This camera shoots 360-degree images! Advertisement We've been intrigued by 360 cameras for some time, and we've seen a number of concepts crop up from startups over the last few years. Ricoh is the only big name imaging company to get in the game. For $350, this is a pricey little toy, but if you've got the guap, the toy is fun!
Its NOT pretty, its NOT professional and.... it is NOT mouse PROOF The day after my DIY Project I was SO disappointed to find I hadn t been successful. On closer investigation I saw two ports of entry that I had overlooked. Two existing holes where pipes came through the drywall This time I used some wire mesh (the kind that keep leaves out of the gutters) and spackling paste. Make do with what you have is a frugal mindset. I cut a square mesh patch, then cut out the size of the pipe and then tacked it to the wall. Then I stuffed the spackling paste in until there was no more hole.Why, yes I did use thumb tacks, Use what you have on hand, remember? After two mouse free days I feel I can forget about my back-up plan and return the cleaning supplies to their home under the sink. I hope I never have to access the pipes in that wall, it may take a jack hammer to get through my patch job. Have you experienced rodents (or other uninvited critters) in your home? If so how did you handle the problem? Please tell me about your experience in the comments.
Both the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones index were hit by losses Tuesday, as concerns again rose about China s economy. The Dow is now down nearly 10 percent in 2015, after falling 469 points Tuesday to close at 16,058. Markets in Europe and Asia also suffered, after renewed worries about a slowdown in China, the world s second-largest economy. "The latest evidence is China s purchasing manager s index," NPR s John Ydstie reports, "which shows the country s manufacturing sector contracting." John says, "Another jolt for the market was a comment from the head of the IMF that growth in Asia could slow even more. The irony is that while U.S. stocks are tanking, estimates of U.S. growth have been upgraded, U.S. auto sales are strong and consumer spending is rising." For U.S. stocks, today s losses were spread around many sectors. Bloomberg News reports: "Energy shares fell for the first time in five sessions as oil retreated after the commodity s strongest three-day rally since 1990. Exxon Mobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips slumped more than 2.8 percent.Banks were among the hardest hit, with Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. losing at least 4.1 percent. Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. sank more than 3.9 percent to drag down technology shares. Copper producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc. dropped 8.2 percent."

KOLKATA: The nationwide trade union strike on Wednesday saw violence in Beharampore and Domkal of Bengal s Murshidabad district, even as normal life in the state was hit. Banking and transport services were suspended. Nearly 200 persons were arrested from different parts of the state and CPM and Trinamool cadres clashed in various places. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that the strike had hardly any impact in the rest of the country, while criticising the CPM: "It has become a bad prac tice of the Marxists to go for bandhs and strikes frequently and I want this bandh culture to be abandoned immediately. Trinamool Congress has not had any bandh in Bengal since 2009. I will follow strictly the Supreme Court and high court orders to prevent bandhs in Bengal," she said, while urging people of Bengal to defeat the bandh culture. "The Marxists have destroyed the state s economy by borrowing hugely and now they have no connection with the masses and still they resort to hooliganism in the name of bandhs. Wednesday s strike was called at a time when our government was work ing to save the flood-hit people of the state." Train services of South Eastern Railway and Eastern Railway were partially affected. Metro Rail services in the city, however, remained normal. Police said there was stone pelting and use of low-intensity bombs in some places in Murshidabad, after which six CPM workers were arrested. The CPM alleged its former Rajya Sabha MP Moinul Hasan was injured when TMC workers attacked a party procession. Trinamool Murshidabad district president Mannan Hossain denied the allegation.

SUNNYVALE -- In a case that worries families of autistic children, two Sunnyvale couples whose homes on Arlington Court flank another occupied for years by an autistic boy and his parents are continuing with a lawsuit against the boy s parents in Santa Clara County Superior Court, saying the boy s behavior created a public nuisance. Among other allegations, over six years the boy apparently entered a neighbor s garage, kicked a car (no damage), pulled a child s hair and tossed items over a fence. The two couples also allege that the boy, now 11, created an "as-yet unquantified chilling effect on the otherwise hot local real estate market" and that "people feel constrained in the marketability of their homes as this issue remains unresolved and the nuisance remains unabated." The parents and their son have since moved to another home in Sunnyvale, and have rented out their Arlington Court home. The lawsuit by the two couples seeks a permanent mandatory injunction against the family, damages according to proof, and attorney fees "insofar as Plaintiffs are seeking to vindicate an important right affecting the public interest, according to the lawsuit, originally filed in June 2014. Bay Area parents of autistic children say they are outraged by the action and that if the two couples prevail, the case could lead to copycat lawsuits that could essentially banish autistic families from neighborhoods everywhere.

Posted Wednesday, September 2nd 2015 @ 5pm by James Dinh As the (unofficial) summer of break-ups comes to a close, there s another couple that has announced their road to splitsville and they go by the name of Chavril also known as Avril Lavigne and Chad Kroeger . Avril took to Instagram on Wednesday (September 2) to share the news along with a photo of the couple from their wedding day. "It is with a heavy heart that Chad and I announce our separation today," the 30-year-old starlet wrote. "Through not only the marriage, but the music as well, we ve created many unforgettable moments. We are still and forever will be, the best of friends, and will always care deeply for each other. To all our family, friends and fans, thank you sincerely for the support." The couple wed back in July 2013 in an intimate ceremony of just 50 invitees. And even though Avril and Chad were hit with several divorce rumors following their marriage, the pair kept tight and stood by each other amidst health issues from both parties. This marks Avril s second star-studded split. She was previously married to Sum 41 rocker Deryck Whibley in 2010. Photo

Bayern Munich's new signing Kingsley Coman said joining the Bundesliga champions was the ideal next step in his career after arriving from Italian giants Juventus on a two-year loan. 'Bayern have a style of play that suits me,' Coman, 19, said during his official presentation on Thursday. 'I'm in good shape. If they ask me to play, I'm ready,' assured Coman, who described himself as a player 'capable of making the difference at any moment during a match'. Bayern have an option to make the move permanent in 2017 when the contracts of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben are set to expire with sporting director Mathias Sammer adding that Coman was a 'perfect alternative' for the duo who are currently out injured. Ribery has been sidelined for the past six months while Robben is set to miss the next four weeks after picking up a groin strain while on international duty with the Netherlands. Coman declared himself 'ready' to feature in Saturday's Bavarian derby at home to Augsburg while Sammer noted the teenager's 'exceptional potential'. 'If the coach decides to play him, then he will burst onto the scene,' assured Sammer. Coman will have to overcome the language barrier but can count on the support of fellow Frenchman Ribery who was there to greet the youngster at Bayern's training centre. 'He (Ribery) is a role model for me,' said Coman, who began his career in his homeland with Paris Saint-Germain before joining Juventus.

ATLANTA - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said on Thursday he is trying to determine whether he has the emotional energy to mount a White House bid in 2016 but cannot say yet whether he can do it. In his first extensive comments about a possible run for the Democratic presidential nomination, Biden said, "I can t look you straight in the eye now and say I know I can do it." Biden, 72, has been huddling with advisers for weeks to determine whether he will challenge Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who has seen her favorability ratings plummet over her use of a private email server while working as the nation s top diplomat. "The most relevant factor in my decision is whether my family and I have the emotional energy to run," said Biden, who lost his son, Beau, to cancer earlier this year. "The factor is, can I do it?" "The honest to God answer is I just don t know." Biden was in Atlanta on Thursday night to deliver a foreign policy lecture.
Cat wants our help finding her fall 2015 perfume 每 she's says she's been moving towards a "daily wear seasonal model" and has come up short for this time of year. The weather where she lives is still too hot for traditional fall fragrances, but she want something beyond greens or florals, which are too spring-like. She'd like to keep the cost below $250. Here is what we know about Cat: She's in her 30s and she lives in the desert. She works in a semi-conservative office. She loves yoga, hiking (when it's cooler), reading and luxury handbags＃ Read the rest of this article 
Hello blogging friends! Lots to share today! Here is my latest layout using my August Clique Kit featuring the Pink Paislee Citrus Bliss collection and some fabulous JustNick background cut files. Did you know you can use the cut files to create a stencil so you can apply paints or ink to your layout or card. I created a stencil with the Funky Rectangles Background. With the stencil in place, I first applied a coat of gesso and let it dry. Then I applied some blue acrylic paint over the gesso. I love the added interest and texture the paint adds. Here is my layout... The flowers I saved from cutting the Fancy Floral background. Don t be so quick to throw those scraps away! Want a closer look? I can t believe this is my first layout with the August kit! I was so excited for this kit!! but since I was on kit duty for the September kit, I didn t have time to play :( I want to remind all of you about Clique Kits monthly challenge. Still a few days left to get your entry in.....Awesome prizes..... Anything Goes..... No excuses! Come join the fun! Thanks for stopping by. Have a great week.
Newcastle will play Championship club Sheffield Wednesday on Wednesday night at St. James' Park in the 3rd round of the League Cup and hopefully we can get a win and that would be our second win this season. In the previous round, we beat Northampton Town 4-1 but this will be a stiffer test 每 with Wednesday being in the middle of the Championship table at present. The Owls will probably fancy their chances given Newcastle are second bottom of the Premier League with only two draws from our first six games. It's a win or defeat and there will be extra time and penalties if required. How Will Newcastle Fare Against Sheffield Wednesday In League Cup? Win Lose View Results Loading ... Comments welcome.

Cebu Daily News' Grace Morallas smiles as she reaches the finish line first to top the 3K division. (CDN PHOTO/ JUNJIE MENDOZA) GRACE Morallas of Cebu Daily News (CDN) won her second straight women's 3-kilometer title in the Press Freedom Run yesterday at the Cebu Business Park. It was actually the fifth straight year that CDN won the women's 3k title of this running event exclusive to media practitioners and part of the week-long celebration of the Cebu Press Freedom Week. From 2011 to 2013, Corra Mae Aliste won the women's 3k title for CDN while Morallas topped last year's race and defended her title yesterday. Aside from Morallas, also winning for CDN was Jenus Benting, who topped the men's 5k category. Benting ended the streak of ultra marathoner Bayani Alvarez of ABS-CBN, who was seeking his fifth straight title in the same category. Alvarez settled for second this time around while Chito Fuentes of Sun Star Daily rounded off the top three. Runners up in the women's 3k were Kristine Grace Cebriano of Sun Star Daily and Flor Mata. Hanz Llerin of Sun Star Daily also made it five in a row after dominating the 5k women's race anew, followed by Donna Lavarez of ABS-CBN. Julius Panerio of The Freeman topped the 3k men's race while CDN's Calvin Cordova and Jay Cris Gunogo completed the top three in the division. The post appeared first on Cebu Daily News .
With TVs coming in different forms these days ( Android TV , Ultra-HD , LED, OLED), shopping for one has become a tad more complicated. So here s a tip: Go with an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) TV 〞it s powered by a technology that produces near-perfect blacks, which means its screen doesn t easily get washed out in terms of visuals! Also, it gives the viewer more viewing angles, resulting to minimal loss of image quality even if you re viewing things at an angle. LG has recently launched one such TV and, by golly, it is a beaut! Look: LG s new 4K OLED TV is 3D-capable and comes with 4K resolution (four times the resolution of regular HD TVs, yo!) to deliver the kind of visual clarity the average display can only dream of. You can also connect it to the Internet via Wi-Fi to watch all the AlDub episodes you ve missed on YouTube. And〞get this〞it even comes with a nice sound bar, a home theater system, and a remote which can actually double as a controller when you connect your Android phone to it or download games from Google Play. How s that for a fully-packed entertainment offering? The LG 4K OLED TV, which comes in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes, will be available in the Philippines in November.

The Guardian reports http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/19/nhs-collapse-former-health-minister-norman-lamb that: The National Health Service will crash within two years with catastrophic consequences unless the government orders an immediate multibillion pound cash injection, the former minister in charge of care services says. The stark assessment from Norman Lamb, minister of state at the Department of Health until May s general election, comes as fears mount among senior NHS officials, care providers and local authorities that NHS and care services are approaching breaking point. Note not the usual could, but will. So in two years when the dysfunctional NHS is still with us will The Guardian ask Norman Lamb why he was wrong?
HOUSTON (KTRK) -- Texans make final cuts to get to down to the mandatory 53 man roster, the most surprising cut is cornerback Charles James. James became a fan favorite during the Pre-season playing both defensive and offensive but the Texans are loaded at corner back. Other cuts Saturday include receiver Chandler Worthy, Defensive Tackle Dan Pettinato and Outside Linebacker Lynden Trail. Due to the severity of his shoulder injury Quarterback Tom Savage placed on the injured reserved list. Meaning the Texans are in the market for another quarterback. (Copyright 2015 KTRK-TV.

To B2B, or Not B2B, That's a Question? By @FrankGreco | @CloudExpo Cloud In the Information Technology (IT) world, the word enterprise is bandied about quite often. First, I really have no idea how to bandy about. If it involves incense and oils, I may have an idea, but lets talk about enterprises instead. If you do some serious digging, youll find out an enterprise is a federation, in other words, a collection of related business units with a common goal of profitability. It is an aggregate, dynamic yet unified entity that provides a product or service to benefit customers in return for revenue and profit. Youll probably hear enterprise loosely and actually incorrectly used interchangeably with company or business. ...
OAKLAND, Calif. -- A woman accused with her husband and former DuPont employees of stealing and selling trade secrets to China for a highly coveted whitener has been sentenced to three years of probation. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White also ordered Christina Liew Tuesday to pay $6 million in restitution. Liew pleaded guilty to conspiracy to tamper with evidence earlier this year as part of an agreement with prosecutors that called for her to receive probation, not prison time. Authorities say Liew and her husband Walter paid retired DuPont employees thousands of dollars for sensitive company documents about how to make the white pigment known as titanium dioxide and then sold the secrets to a DuPont competitor controlled by the Chinese government. The whitener is used in Oreo cookies and represents a multi-billion-dollar industry.
Sept 8 (Reuters) - Surf and skate clothing seller Quiksilver Inc may file for bankruptcy as early as Tuesday evening, Bloomberg reported citing sources. The company s shares crashed 78 percent to 10 cents in extended trading on Tuesday. Oaktree Capital Management will provide debtor-in-possession financing for Quiksilver, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg said. (http://bloom.bg/1ibcouF) Quiksilver and Oaktree Capital Management were not immediately available to comment. Bloomberg had reported last week that Quiksilver was seeking a buyer that could help keep the company afloat. (http://bloom.bg/1IJgQpl) Quiksilver has been struggling in recent years as people moved away from surfwear and skateboarding clothing to fast-fashion retailers like Hennes & Mauritz. The company had reported double-digit percentage decline in revenue in the past five quarters. Quiksilver s shares had lost nearly 80 percent of their value this year through Tuesday s close of 45 cents. (Reporting by Nayan Das in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila) 2015-09-09 00
SOURCE Spherix Global Insights Over 65% of neurologists believe that payers will make generic Copaxone a step edit in multiple sclerosis therapy, according to Spherix Global Insights, GmbH ZUG, Switzerland Other key insights from the research Testing for the JC virus is becoming widespread across therapies, which seems to be driving an increased tolerance of major infections, particularly in the first switch market. With now a third case of PML in the Tecfidera population, it will be interesting to see if testing and training has blunted the impact of these additional cases. While Tysabri is still perceived as most vulnerable to new entrants, most neurologists believe that their patients are well-controlled on existing marketed products. Regardless of safety or efficacy, respondents agree that their current tools enable them to care for most of their patients. At recent congresses, companies were messaging heavily on the value of MRI-based switches, but respondents still believe that disability and relapse are the most relevant criteria for driving clinical decisions. While the broader market options make driving switches more attractive; neurologists remain aligned to traditional measures of success. A more detailed look at switching dynamics in the multiple sclerosis market will be provided in RealWorld Dynamix : DMA Brand Switching Drivers.

The photo of Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul the world has been waiting for has finally arrived: The Daily News snapped a shot of the injured player s right hand. From the looks of the shot below, Pierre-Paul is indeed missing his right index finger and appears to have bandages wrapped around his middle finger and thumb. Before we embed it, we ll give you a WARNING: It is gruesome and may not be for the faint of heart. Here s the photo snapped by the Daily News: 1st Photos of Jason Pierre-Paul s Deformed Hand and Missing Fingers http://t.co/vfpg0k55DK pic.twitter.com/x9JNmY03P3 〞 Robert Littal (@BSO) September 17, 2015 Pierre-Paul had previously been photographed with his hand completely wrapped, and a video he posted of his workout on Wednesday was blurry enough to obscure just how badly damaged his hand was. Coincidently, Pierre-Paul tweeted on Thursday that he couldn t remember the last time his index finger got him a sack. Now, with the damage visible to the public, the world may wonder just how long it will be before Pierre-Paul will return to the field and attempt to get a sack.

A computer-aided imaging system measuring female-pattern hair loss produced results that were comparable to clinical staging using the Savin scale, according to recently published study results. Researchers studied 38 Chinese women with female pattern hair loss (Savin Scale I-2 to II-2). They took 215 photographs and used a computer-aided imaging system (CAIS) was used to calculate central balding areas of each photograph. There was a 7.53% difference in the central balding areas calculated. Average central balding areas were 9,391.12 mm 2 in all patients, 3,828.84 mm 2 in type I-2, 5,880.38 mm 2 in I-3, 8,267.44 mm 2 in I-4, 12,999.26 mm 2 in II-1 and 15,979.71 mm 2 in II-2. There was a clinical correlation between the values of central balding areas and of the Savin scales, with statistical significance in variance between Savin scales ( P < .05). "The CAIS allows physicians to evaluate the severity of baldness more accurately through qualitative visual observation," the researchers concluded. "The values of the [central balding areas] measured by the CAIS, used in conjunction with the present grading systems, may be more precise and efficient to evaluate the severity of [female-pattern hair loss]. "The authors hope this system can also be applied to other diseases of hair loss such as [male-pattern hair loss], alopecia areata, telogen effluvium and scarring alopecia. It can also be used to evaluate other skin disease, such as melasma and vitiligo, by capturing and measuring areas of the skin that are affected." 每 By Bruce Thiel Disclosure: The researchers report no relevant financial disclosures.

Coming out of E3, Horizon: Zero Dawn was probably the AAA game that impressed me most. The idea of a broken future where man has reverted back to cave people fighting robot Dinosaurs? I'm in. The game has been a tough one for Guerrilla Games though. After leaving their comfort zone of Killzone in their past, the developer has now changed perspective and genre to make Horizon . According to managing director Hermen Hulst , who was speaking to Edge Magazine (via Games Radar ), it is the hardest project the studio has ever taken on. After we shipped Killzone: Shadow Fall, and we'd been through the hoopla of doing a launch title, I thought that was going to be the toughest thing we'd ever do. It pales in comparison to this. This is so much more challenging on the team in every single way. But I find that doing something that is this refreshing, and that is supported so strongly by the development team, is probably even more important to the success of a title than how far you are out of your comfort zone. I feel a sense of love for this project among the team, and maybe that sounds corny, but it's really empowering. I really do hope that enthusiasm of being away from Killzone and working on something new comes across in the game. I have huge hopes for the title. Horizon: Zero Dawn Is The Hardest Project Guerrilla Has Ever Worked On
Don t fall for the latest social media trick - Facebook is NOT charging to keep statuses private. A bogus message has been floating around social media, purportedly informing Facebook users that they will have to begin paying fees. Facebook returns after suffering wide outages for the second time in a week Beware of a scam message that reads: "Now it s official! It has been published in the media. Facebook has just released the entry price: 5.99 to keep the subscription of your status to be set to private . If you paste this message on your page, it will be offered free. "If not tomorrow, all your posts can become public. Even the messages that have been deleted or the photos not allowed. After all, it does not cost anything for a simple copy and paste." The message has been circulated on social media dating back to 2009, according to Snopes . Earlier this year, Facebook engaged in an update of its News Feed algorithm in order to cut down on schemes of this type. It s only a shame that the heavily-anticipated Dislike button isn t ready yet, so

5:02pm SAN ANTONIO - Two Texas high school football players who struck a referee during a game have been temporarily moved to an alternative school as investigations continue. Northside Independent School District issued a statement Friday saying the two players from John Jay High School in San Antonio were moved while they await a disciplinary hearing. They reported to the school Friday. Game video shows one of the players blindsiding umpire Robert Watts, and a second player then diving on top of him during a game last week in Marble Falls. The players allege that Watts used racial slurs; Watts denies the allegation. The school district had already suspended the players.

The Mohawk women's softball team lost twice to Kitchener's Conestoga in Ontario Colleges Athletic Association action at Mohawk Sports Park Sunday (Sep. 13). The Mountaineers dropped a tough 8-7, nine-inning decision, in the opening game, but were whipped 32-4 by the Condors in the nightcap. The first game turned into a see-saw battle after four scoreless innings. Lindsay Geffios of Conestoga scored on an error in the top of the seventh inning to tie the game 3-3. The Condors and Mountaineers traded runs in the 8th frame before Conestoga fashioned a four-run ninth for an 8-4 lead. Becky Rabchuk's three run triple with two out in the bottom half of the inning brought the home team to within one, but they couldn't cash in an equalizer. In the second game, Conestoga already ahead 5-0 after one, scored 17 runs in the second inning and added six more in the third. The mercy rule was applied after five innings. The Mountaineers have a doubleheader Wednesday evening (Sept. 16) at Seneca and then host St. Clair Saturday (Sept. 19) for a twin bill at Mohawk Sports park beginning at noon.

There have been struggles between migrants and police in the Hungarian town of Bicske. Chaos broke out as their train, bound for Austrian border, stopped at Bicske, 35 kilometres outside Budapest. Riot police ordered them off, but many resisted, lying on the train tracks or running away. Some wrestled with police, trying to get back on board. There is a migrant reception facility at Bicske. Another train has pulled into Bicske station and people have been allowed to board it. Its destination, however, is unknown. Why has the focus moved on from Budapest? The migrants left Budapest's main railway station on Thursday morning after police stepped aside and let them in. 2,000 had been camped in and around the station for two days. International services are suspended so they boarded local trains, believing they were heading for Austria and Germany.
I was just in church this morning and the good reverend had the courage to speak out on the great evil that is destroying our country. This evil is worse than racial divisions and militant Islam combined. Secular progressivism is our new state religion. Sarah Palin has called it state theism. These secular progressives think that the government is more powerful than God Himself and that Obama is their savior. We must reunite as a Christian nation to survive. God gave us this great land and we will lose it if we continue to turn our back on Him. 252 W. Fourth Street , Wil

RIO DE JANEIRO 〞 Five Brazilian police officers have been taken into custody for allegedly altering a crime scene by placing a gun in the hand of a teenager they allegedly killed during a shootout in a Rio de Janeiro slum. Seventeen-year-old Eduardo Felipe Santos Victor was shot to death Tuesday in the Providencia slum. As he lay dying in a pool of blood, a slum resident videotaped one of the officers firing a handgun into the air and then putting the gun in the youth s hand. The video quickly spread on social media networks. A Providencia resident told the Globo TV network that she saw the shooting and that the victim had tried to surrender. "He was armed but he surrendered," she said. "After he raised his hands, they shot him." The officers involved in the shooting registered the incident saying they acted in self-defense. In a statement, Rio de Janeiro State Security Secretary Jose Mariano Beltrame condemned the killing and promised "exemplary punishment" for the five officers.

At just 22-years old and three seasons in the league, Anthony Davis is making quite a name for himself. The stat stuffer was selected to the All-NBA First Team last season, is a two-time All-Star, and is beginning to enter MVP conversations. In fact he's being mentioned among guys like LeBron James and Kevin Durant but he says he's not quite there yet. "I still have a lot of work to do. I haven't even got out of the first round yet, haven't won a game in the playoffs yet. So there are a lot of steps for me. Them two guys are definitely unbelievable players but I know one day I'm going to be there, I'm going to be the best player in the league if I continue to work hard and keep grinding, keep being dedicated, keep being motivated." Davis is saying the right things, and he understands his ultimate legacy will have to include playoff wins and rings (not to mention MVPs) if he wants to be mentioned with the all-time greats. He's still very young and has a lot of time to acquire those things. He's only going to continue to get better. All he needs is the right supporting cast around him.

The death toll in Quincy from Legionnaires' Disease now stands at ten people. An outbreak first identified in late August has sickened 53 residents at the Veterans Home in Quincy, nine of whom died from the disease, which is a severe type of pneumonia. It's unclear how the tenth victim contracted Legionnaires'. The Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs says it plans to treat the home's water systems with a chemical disinfectant. An agency spokesman could not immediately answer why that step had not been taken sooner. Residents of the veterans home continue to rely on bottled water and sponge baths as a precaution.
Bengaluru: She has certainly razed the glass ceiling as Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)'s first woman Director General (electronics & communication systems cluster), but a day ahead of taking over the top post J Manjula says she never encountered any barriers as she climbed the rungs to this post. A renowned expert in electronic warfare systems and cutting edge communications, she will serve as one of the seven Director Generals heading various clusters, with seven laboratories under her control. "It feels great to be appointed to this highly responsible position. In DRDO, I have never experienced the glass ceiling. The organization has been very good to me," she told Deccan Chronicle. Manjula has served as Director of Defence Avionics Research Establishment, Bengaluru, since July 2014. She said though she considers the top post, a good opportunity, her responsibilities would increase manifold in view of the network of laboratories in this cluster. An alumni of Osmania University, Manjula worked with Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) before joining DRDO in 1987. She served in Defence Electronics Research Laboratory, Hyderabad, for more than 26 years in the area of integrated electronic warfare, and has designed and realised fast signal acquisition receivers, high power RF systems, responsive jammers, and controller software for various systems inducted by the Indian Army, Indian Navy, Indian Air Force and paramilitary forces.

The Gang ready to hit the stage at the Warriors Re-Union at Coney Island last night. @joegoodthings warriorscomeoutandplay A photo posted by Sick Of It All (@sickofitallnyc) on Sep 14, 2015 at 10:26am PDT The worlds of Heavy Metal Movies and NYHC collided in Coney Island last Sunday like baseball bats on the skulls of framed-up street gang members. Thousands of citizens converged on Coney Island to celebrate the 36th anniversary of the release of the Warriors , the iconic 1970s film that schooled a shocked public on the gang warfare and dilapidated glory of New York City streets. This celebration included of a screening of the classic film for a crowd of mega-fans dressed as members of the Baseball Furies, the Punks, the Turnbull A.C's, Boyle Avenue Runners, Moonrunners, and other numerous gangs from the film. Afterwards, Cro-Mags frontman John Joseph led a Q&A panel that included Dorsey Wright, Michael Beck, and other actors from the movies. Afterwards, Sick of it All "came out to play," decked out in their finest Warriors vests, closing the day for a rambunctious crowd. Noisey posted a photo collection HERE . Check out HEAVY METAL MOVIES , whose author Mike "McBeardo" McPadden was raised in the hell of Warriors-era Brooklyn, and NYHC: New York Hardcore 1980-1990 , by Tony Rettman, a book that chronicles what came next in NYC history.
Despite the return of cooler temperatures and some rainfall, the Township of Langley Fire Department advises residents that outdoor burning is not yet allowed. Fire officials will wait until there is a significant amount of rainfall and conditions are not so dangerously dry before lifting the ban. If weather conditions change and water supplies improve over the next few days, burning may be permitted next week. Until then, the Township said, it has zero tolerance for burning offenders and those who contravene the ban will face fines exceeding $200. Water restrictions have been returned to Stage Two by Metro Vancouver, but it is still too dry to allow burning. Under normal conditions, the Township's burning season runs between Sept. 1 and Oct. 31. For more information, call the Langley fire department at 604-532-75
AP With the ball at their own 20 and 36 seconds left in a tie game, the Chiefs could have taken a knee and played for overtime. Coach Andy Reid opted to try to get the team into field-goal range. And on Friday it sounded as if Reid would do the same thing again. "When you have the best running back in the National Football League, I just want to give him opportunities and he's made so many great plays and he will continue to make great plays," Reid told reporters. "Sometimes things don't work, but listen, that kid is all heart and try-hard. It was a situation where, as I mentioned last night, my thinking on it was you pop one, if you have a shot for a field goal, and win the game. That's one thing I'm always going to try to do, I'm going to try to win the game for you there." So the next time the Chiefs are in that same situation, don't look for Reid to instruct his quarterback to take a knee. And that attitude makes sense; over time, the full range of potential outcomes will occur. Chances are that a turnover won't happen the next time around. Unless, of course, it does.
Florida Forest Service Sends Firefighters To Battle Montana Blazes The Florida Forest Service is sending 46 wildland firefighters to Montana as part of a five-crew firefighting unit.

In addition to the latest crew deployment, there are currently more than 98 Florida Forest Service personnel assisting wildfire suppression and wildfire management operations in the western United States. Since April, the Florida Forest Service has provided more than 470 personnel to assist wildland firefighting and management operations in other states. On Monday, a module of five initial-attack hand crews, comprised of Florida Forest Service wildland firefighters and firefighters from partnering agencies left for Montana where they will receive assignment to the highest priority wildfire.

For those of you Black & Decker fans, the wait is finally over. Black & Decker announced they will introduce a new 20V cordless Jigsaw model BDCJS20B. You should start seeing these hit the shelves sometime in Roctober. I don't have much experience with Black & Decker, but do know they are geared towards the homeowner. They tend to be a less expensive tool than some of the professional brands which makes it ideal for a homeowner. The jigsaw features a compact trigger. According to them, this saw has a clear line of sight, but without trying it for ourselves, it's really hard to tell. After reading the press release I was happy to see this isn't just a simple jigsaw that is entering the market. In fact it has many of the professional features, but without the high price tag. The saw should retail for about $50. Some of the features include a keyless blade clamp, bevel shoe, dust blower, trigger lock, electric brake and fan-cooled motor. For $50 it might be a great jigsaw for the homeowner. You will be able to pick these up at Lowes or Menards. For those of us who hate to visit the store, you will also be able to get these on Amazon.

Uyo - Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, has urged people in the state to remain calm amid the perceived assault by operatives of the Department of State Security (DSS) during the recent invasion of Government House. He spoke on arrival from from Abuja at the Ibom International Airport where he assured the matter was before the office of President Muhammadu Buhari. He maintained that Buhari had assured him he would look into the matter. "President Buhari is on top of the situation. He is the President of Nigeria and not the President of a particular party. We just have to be calm and see how he will go about the matter," said Emmanuel. Operatives of the DSS last Thursday invaded the Akwa Ibom State Government lodge, according to critics, without following the due process. It is reported during the raid, the operatives broke into the rooms and guest houses in the Government House, the official residence of Emmanuel. This action has drawn the anger of Akwa Ibom people and groups who have condemned the act. The motive of the raid was not clear.
Updated: Saturday, September 5 2015, 12:31 AM EDT Matt Sims was the quarterback the Bills let go on friday, not Matt Cassel, despite growing speculation Buffalo would cut ties with the veteran Cassel to save money. Sims was one of 17 players cut by the Bills on Friday in an effort to get closer to the final 53 man roster. Buffalo still has to make a couple more moves Saturday to get the roster where it needs to be. Here is the list of players released or waived Friday: Will Campbell John Conner Andre Davis IK Enemkpali Andre Fluellen Quentin Groves Bronson Hill Darryl Johnson Alex Kupper BJ Larsen Merrill Noel Tobias Palmer Cyril Richardson Matt Simms Cierre Wood Dez Lewis The Bills also placed cornerback Leodis McKelvin on the Reserve/Non-Football Injury list, meaning he will miss at least the first six games of the regular season.

Fabian Bimmer/Reuters/Landov Switzerland has announced that it will temporarily halt the sale of Volkswagen diesel-engine vehicles after it was revealed earlier this month that the automaker cheated on emissions tests. Thomas Rohrbach, spokesman for the Swiss federal office of roadways, is quoted by The Associated Press as saying that "the ban is on all cars with diesel engines in the euro 5 emissions category . It includes all VW models 〞 as well as Seat, Skodas and others in the VW group." The BBC says that could affect 180,000 unsold cars in the country that have 1.2-liter, 1.6-liter and 2-liter diesel engines. The news follows developments on Friday that included the appointment of a new CEO, Matthias Mueller, and announcements in Germany that emissions tests on 2.8 million VWs in the country had been rigged. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also said it was tightening its testing procedures. Copyright 2015 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/ .
It s tax increase day at the Alabama House of Representatives. A package backed by Republican House leaders to raise taxes by about $130 million to help close a projected shortfall in the General Fund is up for debate. The bills would raise taxes on cigarettes, car titles, car rentals and businesses. Pharmacies and nursing homes would also pay new taxes to benefit Medicaid. Those are scheduled to expire after 2017. Another bill would move $50 million from an education savings account to the General Fund, with a commitment to repay that in three years. The bills are part of a plan to close a projected $200 million shortfall in the General Fund for the budget year that begins Oct. 1. The plan would close most of the shortfall and help avoid deep cuts in health care, law enforcement, courts and other programs, officials say. The proposals fall short of the $260 million Gov. Robert Bentley is seeking. The Democratic minority, which holds 33 of the 104 seats, generally opposes the tax package.

PROTESTERS who claim they were threatened with rape and drowning on a Victorian military base have launched a legal bid to get the names of Defence Force officers. SAM Quinlan, Greg Rolles and David Sprigg swam to the Swan Island military base from Queenscliff in October 2014 to protest Australia s involvement in foreign wars. They say they were thrown to the ground and dragged, had bags put over their heads and were stripped naked. One was allegedly threatened with rape and another with drowning. Maurice Blackburn lawyer Jacob Varghese said the Australian Defence Force had refused to release the names of the officers involved so they could be sued. "These men are peaceful protesters who were prepared to accept the lawful consequences of their actions but they did not deserve this violent assault on their dignity," Mr Varghese said on Tuesday. Read more "The protesters experienced brutal, degrading and humiliating treatment at the hands of Defence Force personnel." In October last year, Army chief Lieutenant General David Morrison said the allegations would be taken seriously and investigated. The protest at Swan Island was a regular event staged by the Swan Island peace group, objecting to the US alliance and Australian involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Australian Defence Force has been contacted for comment.

Young Money artist Flow, described by some as a prot谷g谷 of Lil Wayne, has been arrested following a grand jury indictment charging him in the deaths of two men in New Orleans. As previously reported, Flow was briefly booked earlier this summer before posting his $500,000 bail.

According to local authorities, Chantell Edwards was also accused in the new indictment as an accessory to the murders, though he currently remains at large.

MCPHERSON 每 The County Attorney in McPherson County, Torrence Parkins announced Friday evening that a sheriff Deputy's use of deadly force on March 31, against a suspect, Jeffrey Snow was justified. The Sheriff's office reported that two deputies responded to a reported battery in the McPherson County community of Canton.

Posted Thursday, September 10th 2015 @ 5pm by Michael Harthorne, Newser Staff ( NEWSER ) 每 Attorneys who fought for the rights of same-sex couples around the country want taxpayers to know how much their lawmakers cost them by obstinately waging a losing battle against gay marriage, Al Jazeera America reports. In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling this summer, lawyers for the plaintiffs in multiple same-sex marriage cases〞who mostly worked pro bono〞are using a 1976 law that allows them to collect "reasonable attorney s fees" from local governments should they win their case. "Some of the tactics the state used were unnecessarily dragging out the time spent and the cost of the litigation. You have government officials who knew very well where this was headed and nonetheless defended these discriminatory laws," one lawyer tells Al Jazeera. "It's the price governments pay for defending bigotry," says another. Read the full story on Newser.com

The Trace Last Wednesday morning, police in the semi-rural Connecticut town of Orange received a flurry of reports that someone was breaking into vehicles. One of the callers was 66-year-old Vincent Brescia, who informed authorities that his loaded .38-caliber revolver had been snatched from the glove compartment of his unlocked truck, which was parked in his driveway overnight. The notice came well within the state's mandatory 72-hour period to report lost or stolen firearms, but instead of officers leaving the scene with just an incident report, they charged Brescia with breaking the law. Though he "expressed remorse for failing to lock his car," Brescia was arrested for misdemeanor reckless endangerment, the Town of Orange Police Department announced on its Facebook page. Brescia's pistol permit was also seized and sent to the licensing and firearms unit of the Connecticut State Police for review. Anthony Cuozzo, the assistant chief of the Orange Police Department and a self-described "gun guy" who is also a firearms instructor, tells The Trace that Brescia was a "good citizen" for reporting his gun stolen. "But the number one tenet of responsible gun ownership is that the gun is properly secured and the owner maintains control of that gun," he says.

Say you ve begun a new religion. Congratulations! Now you need followers. You could stand on a street corner and shout at people. You could serve the poor and provide for those in need, attracting people with your kindness and generosity. If you re powerful, you could compel them by law to convert. But those aren t very effective ways of getting your religion to spread far and wide and really stick. I know what you need: a religious text! Yes, a holy book is exactly what you need to reach people out of shouting range and to make sure people don t garble your message in our great divine game of telephone. Most actual, real-world religions have some kind of holy text, but it d be a mistake to think that they all treat their text the same way, or that members of the same faith treat their same book the same way. Scholars call the way people interpret a text a "hermeneutic" (her-man-OO-tic). If you re going to understand a religion that has a text, you ve got to understand the different kinds of hermeneutics you might run into. To do that, I m going to show you how similar hermeneutics pop up in our geeky fiction.
9:00am BEIRUT - The Lebanese government is launching a campaign to register 100,000 new students from among the Syrian refugee population in its already overwhelmed public schools. The figure is double the number of refugees who were able to enrol last year. Education Minister Elias Bou Saab said Monday this will give more refugee children a chance at free education. But he cautioned that nearly the same number of Syrian refugee children are still out of schools. He says that if more refugee children enrol in schools, this may stem the flow of migrants from the region to Europe. Lebanon is struggling with at least 1.1 million registered Syrian refugees who fled their country s civil war, now in its fifth year. Bou Saab says Syrians could soon outnumber Lebanese in public schools. The Canadian Press

ATHENS, Ga. -- Georgia quarterback Greyson Lambert set the NCAA record for completion percentage in a single game during the seventh-ranked Bulldogs 52-20 win over South Carolina (1-2, 0-2 SEC) on Saturday. Lambert finished the night 24-of-25 passing (96 percent) for a career-high 330 yards with three touchdowns. Former Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin (23 of 24) and former West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith (23 of 24) previously held the NCAA record for completion percentage with 95.8 percent. A minimum of 20 completions is needed to be eligible for the mark. Lambert, who transferred to Georgia from Virginia over the summer as a graduate student, also broke Georgia s record for consecutive passes completed in a single game with 20. The previous record of 19 was held by current Colorado State coach Mike Bobo, who previously served as Georgia s offensive coordinator for eight years. Georgia (3-0, 2-0) finished the night with a season-high 576 yards and averaged 9.1 yards per play. The Bulldogs 52 points was the most ever by Georgia against a Steve Spurrier-coached team.
Kids and adolescents get an average of 12.4 percent of their daily calories from fast food, according to a study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s National Center for Health Statistics. Using data gathered from a 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the study reported that kids ages 12 to 19 ate twice as many calories from fast food restaurants as children ages two to 11. In total, a third of children and adolescents from ages two to 19 ate fast food on a given day. The researchers did not find any differences in caloric consumption by gender, weight or poverty status. However, they did find that non-Hispanic Asian children ate considerably less calories from fast food restaurants compared to non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic children. "Previous studies have reported that acculturation to the U.S. lifestyle plays an important role in the adoption of unhealthy behaviors, such as fast food consumption, in Asian-American and other immigrant groups," according to the authors of the study. The obesity rate in children has more than doubled in the past 30 years, rising from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18% in 2012. The obesity rate among adolescents more than quadrupled, growing from 5 percent to nearly 21 percent over the same period, according to the CDC.

The search for the suspect in the shooting of a police cruiser in Millis, Massachusetts. A part-time police officer who claimed to have been shot at on Wednesday before getting into a f iery car accident with his cruiser completely fabricated the story, police said. Millis Police Sgt. William Dwyer said the only ballistics evidence recovered at the scene was shots fired by the officer into his own cruiser. Based on that and other evidence, it ws determined that the officer made up the story that he was shot at by a man in a pickup truck. Police said they are not sure if the officer set his own car on fire. The officer s name is not being released until formal charges are brought against him. He is 27 years old. "I still am very upset and don t know exactly how to feel right now," Dwyer said at a Thursday afternoon press conference announcing the shocking development. Police said they are not sure if Wednesday s school threat was connected to the officer s fabricated shooting story. Wednesday s report that a Millis Police cruiser had been shot at just before 2:30 p.m. brought a massive police response, including state and local police and a SWAT team. Rifle-toting officers canvassed the Forest Road area as neighbors were asked to shelter in place while the search for a suspect continued. Millis schools were closed Thursday as a precaution. The middle school had received a call around 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday from someone who indicated a crime might occur in the town. An hour later, the school received a bomb threat by telephone.

An air stewardess who smuggled shisha tobacco into the UK from Dubai, evading more than 57,000 in excise duty, has been jailed. Jade Kaur, 27, from Brompton Road, Stretford, was caught with 25kg of non-UK duty paid shisha tobacco and 3,200 cigarettes in her luggage when stopped by HM Revenue and Customs Border Force officers at Manchester Airport last November. An investigation uncovered messages on her mobile phone that proved she had carried out at least a dozen similar long-haul trips while off duty. Kaur owned up to illegally bringing 275kg of shisha into the UK between July 2014 and November last year while flying in on staff-discounted tickets from Dubai, where she was based at the time, to Manchester. At Manchester Crown Court, she pleaded guilty to three counts of fraudulent evasion of excise duty and was jailed for 18 months. The total duty evaded on the 275kg of shisha tobacco and 3,200 mixed-brand cigarettes was 57,202. Sandra Smith, assistant director of HMRC's Fraud Investigation Service, said: "As an air stewardess, Kaur knew exactly what she was doing was illegal, yet kept on going for months purely to line her own pockets. But now the game is up and she is paying the highest price by losing her freedom, not to mention her career."

Last month they were trialling table service in Manchester. And now? Some McDonalds in Sweden are letting you book tables online in advance, like it's a real restaurant or something. The Swedish branches are working with online booking service Bookatable.se so that you can reserve seating for up to four people. Staffan Ekstam, director of menu strategy and product development at McDonald s Sweden told The Local: "We want to give burger lovers a unique experience at McDonald s. We already have table service in some restaurants in France and Germany...now we are going to check if this {online booking} works and if there is demand for it and then we will follow up on the functionality." Ekstam added "If it works then we will do more trials, but these will only be in Sweden for now". So us non-Swedes are going to be left fighting over seating like the classless scum we are.

People have democratic rights to choose whatever is feasible for them. The government should adopt the collective public opinion instead of forcing its opinion on the people, Qasmi said. He added, We see cow with respect and its milk is used in ghee and medicines, so how it is bad for health. The Gauseva and Gauchar Vikas Board website says the Gauseva Ayog, created in 1999 and expanded as Gauseva and Gauchar Vikas Board in 2012, was "established for preservation, development and welfare of the cow and its progeny". The Gauseve Vikas Board is under the aegis of the Agriculture and Cooperation Department, Gujarat government.

Mr. Vehnee Saturno s music has influenced us Pinoys for many decades now regardless of social class, gender, etc., and worked with many recording artists up until now. I had an opportunity to talk to him on one occasion during a presscon of one recording artist that he worked with more than a year ago. Imagine if all those songs from those years are compiled to tell a story in a musical. This is what Stages Production Specialist Inc. is going to stage next month for 4 performance and then in January next year. The plot of the musical was conceptualized two years ago. The story started with sisters Dina and Darla who witnessed a murder and went to Manila to hide and found refuge in a gay bar called Mr. Kupido where they pretend to be gay impersonators. The musical is originally Pinoy so the target audience are local. There are only few musicals that we can be proud of and this is one production to add on that list. Vehnee Saturno always ponder about doing a musical but he didn t get a chance to start until Stages provided the right material and choice of songs to be included in the musical. Here is one of the featured songs as interpreted by Joanna Ampil during the media launch. For more musical productions, follow this blog and like L.E.N.S. blogs on Facebook.

℅ No charges against Cleveland Browns offensive line coach accused of assault BEREA, Ohio 〞 No charges will be filed against Cleveland Browns offensive line coach Andy Moeller, sources told the FOX 8 I-Team. Berea City Prosecutor Jim Walters released the ruling Wednesday morning. (Read the full statement here) The FOX 8 I-Team reported earlier this month that Moeller was being investigated for an alleged assault. The Browns suspended Moeller indefinitely right the allegations surfaced. Wednesday, a Cleveland Browns spokesman released the following statement: "Andy Moeller's suspension by the team remains indefinite. We will withhold further comment until the appropriate time." The alleged incident happened at Moeller's home in Berea earlier this month. A female friend called police to the house, saying Moeller had attempted to strangle her. She at first told police she wanted to file charges, and then later changed her mind. The incident was not considered a possible domestic case because the woman does not live at the house and is not related to Moeller. This isn't the first time Moeller has been suspended. The Baltimore Ravens suspended Moeller for two games in 2011 for violating the league's personal conduct policy following a conviction for driving under the influence.

Jerry Dahmen, Results Radio The crime is the same but Sioux Falls Police are not ready to call them connected. Forged video lottery tickets took two businesses by surprise. Officer Sam Clemens describes the crimes as similar. One of them happened at the 18th Amendment on 41st Street and the other at T.C.'s Referee on 26th Street. A person won $100 at the 18th Amendment on 41st Street. The suspect then left the establishment, came back and cashed the ticket worth $600. As each establishment resolved the account for the day, that's when the business discovered the discrepancy. "The report says the ticket was altered," said Clemens. However it is not fully known how the suspect changed the dollar amount. "I think we've seen that before where they've scanned it, and then alter it on the computer and then print it out again. (It's possible) they used some type of pen or pencil." Word to the wise would be to double-check tickets when they are submitted. "Once they looked closely at the tickets then that's when they realized they had been altered." The dissimilar characteristics in the crimes come in two forms. One comes in the description of the suspect. Clemens says they do not match. The other being in the timing as Police report the 18th Amendment indicating the lottery win and the pick up of winnings happening on the same day. At T.C.'s Referee, the forged ticket came in one day later.
